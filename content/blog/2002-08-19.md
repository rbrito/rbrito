My father travelled to Luc√©lia today.

To break the tradition, I took the later part of the day to visit
my uncle's place with my mother to distract myself a bit, something
that I need. My uncle cooked some pasta with bacon and we spent
some quite nice moments having dinner. It is healthy to do
different things in a while.
