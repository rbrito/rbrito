Much to my delight, I received today some nice people for my
birthday. [Adriano](http://www.binoklo.com/)'s presence was nice
(and I even had the opportunity to play with his last generation
iBook G4, and fix his keyboard), my Grandma, Jacob, Mom, Dad, Rose,
and Sa made a nice birthday party.

And, of course, being with Adriano is always illuminating: I
learned about a book, about
[a movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089457/), about some MacOS X
programs that he runs, about some other concepts, about an
[independent game](http://www.worldofgoo.com/) that he supported
for MacOS X and so on. Always a pleasure to talk with him.
