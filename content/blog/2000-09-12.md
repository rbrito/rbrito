My aunt's birthday today. Tried to call her, but who said it would
be possible?

It seems that a customer of mine that was giving me headaches when
I tried to receive for a job that I did for him (interconnecting
his computers with other places) finally gave up avoiding to pay
me. Nothing like a good threat.

One of my [best friends](http://www.ime.usp.br/~lymber/) (if not
the best) lent me some Vivaldi and I've ripped everything and
encoded with a version of [LAME](http://www.sulaco.org/mp3/) that
I've packaged for Debian.

My [advisor](http://www.ime.usp.br/~jose/) and I decided that we
should start with my research. Now I need a subject.
