A busy day working -- lots of phone calls helping a customer to get
his Windows 2000 working correctly with IP routing. Then (on the
bright side), made the Linux boxes of another customer's
[ISP](http://www.netlink.psi.br) work well with Radius
authentication services. Unfortunately, we could not test it, but
everything there looks good. We'll see tomorrow if there are any
complaints.

BTW, [KDE 2.2.1](http://www.kde.org/) was released today. That's
great, since it is a quite advanced Desktop Environment for Linux
available now and is way more polished than
[GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) is, at least IMO. It will hit
[sid](http://www.debian.org/releases/sid/) in some days and soon
will be in [woody](http://www.debian.org/releases/woody/) (I
hope).

Lots of new things in the Debian incoming repository: KDE 2.2.1,
KOffice 1.1, Broadcast 2000, dillo, and Java 1.3. Woohoo!
