Today I went to a new psychotherapist. The *modus operandi* of this
person has me wondering a bit if it will work out evenly. I'm
skeptical of the
[Neuro-linguistic programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurolinguistic_programming)
approach.

Today was also Mom's birthday. We had a private (and mini) party
here and we took many pictures more than I have ever taken in any
session. Of course, what use would be a digital camera with a 2GB
[SD card](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD_Card) (that the camera
claims can fit approximately 4500 pictures into) if we don't
register moments like these?
