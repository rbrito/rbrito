Took the day to see how things regarding the old PowerMac
9500/180MP were with a
[newer XFree86](http://people.debian.org/~branden/). Apparently,
[XFree86 4.2](http://www.xfree86.org/) doesn't support the XVideo
extension for the `imst`t adapter, which is quite a pity.

What this means is that I am not able to use
[Xine](http://xine.sf.net/) or [Mplayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/)
to efficiently play videos on this computer.

I can see some things that make this computer slow:

* It has a modest amount of RAM for today's standards (64MB,
  which is particularly little for PowerPC);
* I don't know if it's RAM chips are in an interleaved
  configuration or not;
* If it had a faster/better supported video card (say, like a
  [ATI](http://www.ati.com/) Mach64), things would perhaps be better,
  but this is just a guess. I don't know if the Mach64 sports XVideo
  support under PowerPC, but perhaps the
  [Gatos](http://gatos.sf.net/) project might help here;
* I have no idea why this computer, while having a SCSI interface
  and drive, is so slow while it is using the disk. I see two things:
  it freezes most things the user (that's me!) whenever it is writing
  (reading?) anything to (from?) the disk and the transfer speeds are
  quite sloooow. I wonder if this is a problem of the Linux SCSI
  infra-structure, if it is a problem of the hardware or if it is a
  problem of configuration. It probably isn't a problem with Linux,
  since I also see the slowness with [MacOS](http://www.apple.com/)
  Classic (8).

Anyway, just for fun, I tried to install
[MacOS X 10.1](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) on this old computer.
The catch is that MacOS X can't be installed on anything this old.
Well, at least, that's what Apple says. I had to grab a copy of
MacOS 9 (in German!) just to bootstrap the system. Then, using
[XPostFacto](http://eshop.macsales.com/OSXCenter/XPostFacto/), the
installation was quite smooth (and slow). But with one gotcha at
the first reboot: a kernel panic.

After that, I went to sleep.
