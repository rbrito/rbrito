Now I am officially a
[Debian Maintainer](http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/d/debian-maintainers/current/changelog#versionversion1.45).
I'm very happy now. This means that I can upload my own packages to
[Debian](http://www.debian.org/), without pestering
[Rhonda](http://alfie.ist.org/) about them. But I still want her
opinions on some packages, given the experience that she has.

And it seems that I'll be part of another project,
[lossyWAV](http://sf.net/projects/lossywav), given the current
discussions on
[hydrogenaudio forums](http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=65499&st=50&gopid=589938).

Oh, and only today I realized that
[Ubuntu's Intrepid Ibex](http://www.ubuntu.com/) alpha 6 was
released. Time to go downloading things to use on my most recent
purchase...

On a more musically related note, Symphony X
[will be coming here](http://whiplash.net/materias/news_883/077645-symphonyx.html)
to SÃ£o Paulo, which is a nice thing.
