Arrived at
[IMECC](http://www.ime.unicamp.br/)-[Unicamp](http://www.unicamp.br/)
in Campinas for the congress today. Let me understand this city
(full of curiosities). It is not that easy to get around here, it
seems.

Without knowing, I happened to discover that the hotel where I
stayed had Wireless Internet Connection, in a quite interesting
configuration: it is "open", without any encryption protocol (no
WEP, nor WPA).

They control the access to their network via a transparent proxy
that intercepts the traffic of the client and, then, upon
authentication, it opens all the ports and this includes access to
SSH! (I'd expect this to be a quite uncommon situation, since
people regard "Internet access as *Inter-web*").
