[an e-mail](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/tutor/2002-April/013664.html)
to the Python Tutor mailing list regarding what I think is a bug. I
still think it is.

[Opera](http://www.opera.com/) is growing more and more on me. I
think that I will register a copy in the future. It can at least
[print things which Mozilla can't](http://www.nupedia.com/article.phtml?id=678).

And I really like [Nupedia](http://www.nupedia.com/). A great
effort which deserves more input.
