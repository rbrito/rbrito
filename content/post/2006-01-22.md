Trying to catch up with most of the things that I still have to do.
Sleeping well was one of these things.

And tomorrow is my student's midterm. I hope that they find the
test challenging while, at the same time, informative.

The CWEB implementation of my Gauss Integers class in C++ with
computation of quotient and remainder is getting cleaner. But I'd
still like to implement it in a better "literate style" and use the
"Cheshire Cat" trick to have better use of data encapsulation.
