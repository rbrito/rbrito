Today I was pleasantly surprised that the Kurobox that
[Riku Voipio](http://suihkulokki.blogspot.com/) sent me has
arrived! From the looks of it, it is a Kurobox HG, which, compared
to my Kurobox HD, has a faster processor (it runs at 266MHz,
instead of 200MHz), has more RAM (128MB, instead of 64MB), and has
a faster network connection (an 1Gbps instead of 100Mbps
interface).

I'm trying to see if I will be able to use a SATA drive with this
Kurobox, as we can't find large IDE/PATA drives in the market today
(almost). And the bigger capacity ones are only available with SATA
interfaces.
