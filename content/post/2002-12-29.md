It's been quite a while since I last updated my diary. Many things
preventing me from updating it, which is good (well, at least part
of the things are good).

Been working towards finishing my M.Sc. degree. It seems that the
end never comes!

I've also been using [MacOS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/)
(Jaguar) a lot lately. In some ways, it is a nice operating system.
But the lack of a real package management system is a bad thing. I
think that I've been spoiled by [Debian](http://www.debian.org/)'s
incredible (and clean) service. Unfortunately,
[Fink](http://fink.sf.net/) isn't as good as Debian. And there are
quite few programs in binary form from Fink. And they don't have a
menu system like Debian's `menu`. And they don't even have
[Windowmaker](http://www.windowmaker.org/) available! And AUCTeX.
etc

Saw that [Limewire](http://www.limewire.com/) is uploaded to
Debian's incoming repository, which is cool. Also discovered this
[`muttprint`](http://muttprint.sf.net/) package, which sounds
promising. Packaged for Debian also, of course.
