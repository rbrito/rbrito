Spent a good part of the day doing homework. Two of 'em, in fact.
One, due Monday. The other, due Tuesday. I'm more enthusiastic
about Combinatorial Optimization than programming Turing Machines,
but both classes I'm attending are cool. For someone that enjoys
theoretical Computer Science, that is. Amazingly, the theory is not
far from the Real World (tm).
