Had the *quite pleasant* news that I had my first peer-reviewed
work accepted to the
[CNMAC'2006](http://www.congresscentral.com.br/cnmac) Congress (The
National Applied and Computational Mathematics Congress).

The work was entitled "Complexidade de Alinhamentos de Seqüências
Biológicas" ("Computational Complexity of Biological Sequence
Alignments"). This is a quite welcome addition to
[my curriculum](http://lattes.cnpq.br/0890412916137605).
