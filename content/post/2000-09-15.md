*Moz... What!?!* [Konqueror](http://www.konqueror.org) all the way!
Fast and small. It seems that KDE 2 (now, also packaged for Debian)
is looking really promising. I mean: it's the 4th beta, but I
haven't had any problems using it for the last few hours. And
[Koffice](http://koffice.kde.org) is also sweet.
