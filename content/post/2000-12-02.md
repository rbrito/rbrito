I'm now mirroring both a repository of
[Debian KDE packages](http://kde.tdyc.com) for potato and
[Helix Gnome](http://www.helixcode.com) for Debian with rsync. It's
*way* better than mirroring with wget, that's for sure.

I was expecting to go to the movies today, but due to some (ahem)
"technical problems", I wasn't able to go. And this made me quite
sad, but that's not actually a problem. Perhaps next week.

Repackaged [LAME](http://lame.sourceforge.net/) 3.87beta for
Debian/potato and it is lintian-clean (!). So far, it seems to be
good and I think that I'll post a message to debian-mentors asking
what could be improved. In fact, the only thing that I don't like
in my package is the fact that I've hardcoded a Build-Depends:
libncurses5-dev line in the control file. That's not quite right,
IMO, and I'll learn how to change it soon.

My next step is to package [DJB](http://cr.yp.to/djb.html)'s
utilities qmail, ucspi-tcp, serialmail and checkpassword. The
former seems to be quite involved, but the latters seem to be
trivial enough to package in one afternoon only (am I optimistic or
what?) and then I'll be able to switch to my brand new computer
(MICROS\~1 free) with Debian 2.2 + KDE 2.2 + my local packages (I
still won't have XFree86 4.0.1 and all its nifty features, since
I'll be waiting for a version of it to be compiled for potato;
using woody is scary).

Another package that I may be interested in packaging is a
ftpparse-ified version of wget (for mirroring
[publicfile](http://cr.yp.to/publicfile.html) repositories).
