Updated [lame](http://lame.sf.net/)'s Debian packaging a little
bit. Now it correctly reports version 3.92. This closed a bug in
[sourceforge](http://sf.net/projects/lame/). Some other changes are
on the pipeline (like getting rid of the dreaded `rpath`, with
[a recipe](http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2002/debian-devel-200207/msg01792.html)
I got from [debian-devel](http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/)).
The only thing remaining is to test it on x86 and powerpc before I
commit it.

Worked a little bit (well, not *that* little) on my Master's
thesis, fixing the beginnings of chapter 2.
