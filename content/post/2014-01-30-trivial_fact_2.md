I don't know how Debian planet deals with MathJax (it seems to
become illegible), but I will try to post this, anyway.

<br>

**Fact:** Since the harmonic numbers can be approximated by the
natural logarithm, that is, $H_n \simeq \ln n$, we can clearly
see that
\[
 \frac{1}{i+1} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n} = H_n - H_i \simeq \ln n - \ln i = \ln \frac{n}{i},
\]
which is a trivial approximation that may be handy sometimes.

If you spot any errors on this, please let me know.
