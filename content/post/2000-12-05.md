The last day of classes of Computational Complexity. I'm both happy
and sad. I'm happy because it was quite demanding, with loads of
homework. But on the other hand, the subject is so cool and I'll
certainly miss it.

I plan to buy Papadimitrou's book "Computational Complexity", but I
must be sincere here and say that I'm quite scared of the sheer
amount of typos and small errors that this book contains. Indeed if
you ignore those errors, then the book is really good. I guess that
it needs a beta-testing phase as it is feature complete.
