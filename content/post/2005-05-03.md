[Debian](http://www.debian.org/)'s
[sarge](http://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) release is now
[officially frozen](http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/05/msg00001.html)
and its release is expected to occur at the end of this month! Wow!
After
[almost 3 years without a new release](http://www.nl.debian.org/releases/woody/),
my favourite Operating System is being released again! Sooo
sweeeet!
