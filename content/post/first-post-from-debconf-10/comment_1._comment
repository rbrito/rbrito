This was my first Debconf as well and I was glad to meet you at the event. Thank you for making me feel welcome in Debian even though I'm new here.

P.S. the updates to the package I am working on http://packages.debian.org/sid/xtrkcad were implemented, sponsored, and uploaded the day before the freeze.
