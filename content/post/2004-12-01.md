Dear Santa, I've been a good kid for ages. Why can't I have the
things that I wished for? I'd love to have a SO with stress on the
**S**. Why have things gone *so* wrong nowadays?

Well, finally, anyway, my TOEFL scores have arrived at the proper
department at [Oz](http://www.newcastle.edu.au/). Now, only a few
documents are pending to know if I can get a Scholarship.

But more than anything else, I'd really like to be happier. But I
am not. Life is painful right now. And to fit my current mood, I've
been listening to Monolithe, Shape of Despair, Skepticism and The
3rd and the Mortal. Beautiful music.
