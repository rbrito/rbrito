I have always thought that having flexible deadlines in MOOCs is important,
despite not having used them too much. Until last night, that is.

The course in question is Stanford's [Statistical Learning][0] and they
adopted a policy of letting the students complete all the assignments of the
10 week course until the last day of the course, in March 21. Then, they
graciously extended the deadline to April 4.

Were it not for such an extension, I would not have completed the course. I
sent them a message on the course forums this morning to thank them for
this, as this, in my experience, is not so common with MOOCs.

I reproduce below the message that I posted on the forums:
