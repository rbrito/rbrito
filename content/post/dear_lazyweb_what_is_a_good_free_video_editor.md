Let's suppose that you went to a show of your favourite some time ago and
you were able to sneak in a camera (well, in those times, cell phones
weren't able to record much more than 176x144 pixels at 12fps).

But, then, you suddenly found that some people uploaded (short) fragments of
that very same show to youtube and, collecting those, you may be able to
create a "multi-camera" version of the video that you can record to keep of
your memorable concert.

The multi-camera, in the sense above, is not the same as
[multiple angles][0] (like some DVDs), but something like a TV broadcast,
where the stage is filmed by cameras positioned at some places and the image
that is broadcast is switched from time to time according to that who is
singing, or playing etc.

So, Dear Lazyweb, do we happen to have any Free Software (preferably already
packaged in Debian) that is able to help with the task of "aligning" (in
time) videos from various (different) sources so as to produce one
multi-camera video?

What would my options be? I [asked this][1] on youtube for a person that
[did exactly what I want][2] and [their answer][3] was [Sony Vegas][4],
which I fear that does not exactly would be allowed in Debian. :)

Any comments are welcome, thanks, and if I am successful, I will upload the
final video. :)
