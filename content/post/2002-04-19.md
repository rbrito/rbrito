Wow, so many things going in software-land that if I don't write
about soon, I'll probably forget.

The best thing, of course, is that
[Woody](http://www.debian.org/releases/woody/) is set to a
(tentative) release on May, 1st. This is *amazing*!

Also, newer versions of the following programs are available:
[Python](http://www.python.org/) 2.2.1,
[Opera](http://www.opera.com/) for i386 6.0beta2,
[Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/) 1.0RC1,
[MacOS](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) X 10.1.4,
[Internet Explorer](http://www.mactopia.com/) for MacOS 5.1.4,
[Fink](http://fink.sf.net/) 4.0, [lame](http://lame.sf.net/) 3.92,
[Chimera](http://chimera.mozdev.org/) 0.2.0,
[woody's netinst images](http://) 20020416,
[vlc](http://www.videolan.org/) 0.3.0. And I still haven't tried
[KDE](http://www.kde.org/) 3.0,
[Yellowdoglinux](http://www.yellowdoglinux.com/) 2.2 and
[XFree86](http://www.xfree86.org/) 4.2.0, to name a few (big) new
releases. And that's *not* all: soon there will be newer versions
of [xine](http://xine.sf.net/), [mplayer](http://mplayer.sf.net/),
[ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.sf.net/), and
[kaffe](http://www.kaffe.org/)!

So much (new) software, so little time!

And then, somewhere, a Microsoft's spoke-person said something like
"the open source people don't know how many things we have done in
Windows-land". Well, of course, MacOS X, Internet Explorer and
Opera aren't exactly open source. But the amount of new software
just released (or in the process of being released) is just so
damned huge. I guess, if he only knew (or didn't pretend he didn't
know) what the open source community did in the past days, he would
be ashamed of his comments. But then, again, it isn't uncommon for
people driven by money being, ahem, how can I say, "dishonest".
