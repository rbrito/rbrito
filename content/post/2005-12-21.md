So, I have finally gotten some free time for my own projects! Wow!
It was a quite hectic semester this one. Fortunately, it's over
now.

As previously hinted, I have now started (*slowly*) learling
German, thanks to [Deutsche Welle](http://www.dw-world.de/) (and to
a hint given by student of mine; thanks Victor).

Changing the subject completely, creating DVDs under Linux is
really, really simple, given the proper tools. Right now, I'm using
the following (quite simple) script to generate the material that
is later processed by [dvdauthor](http://dvdauthor.sf.net/):

    #!/bin/sh

    # Chamada: <video_in> <video_out>
    #

    # video encoding
    [ -e stream.yuv ] || mkfifo stream.yuv
    mplayer -noframedrop -vo yuv4mpeg -ao pcm $1 &

    yuvdenoise -v 0 -r 16 -l 4 < stream.yuv | \
        yuvscaler -v 0 -n n -M BICUBIC -O VCD | \
        mpeg2enc -v 0 -f 8 -b 6000 -K kvcd -g 6 -G 18 -N 1.0 -V 500 -n n -F 4 -a 2 -q 2 -4 1 -2 1 -D 10 -B 160 -o $2.mpv

    # audio encoding
    toolame -t 2 -b 160 -v -5 audiodump.wav $2.mpa

    # multiplexing
    mplex -o $2.mpg -f 8 -V $2.mpv $2.mpa

    # clean-up
    rm -f audiodump.wav *.mpv *.mpa stream.yuv
