Didn't really got decent sleep (I actually went to bed at 6am+, no
kidding) and woke up by 12pm to bring
[my supervisor](http://www.ime.usp.br/~cris/) all the student's
programs. After everything was finished, I felt like a slave seeing
light and being free. Wow.

Went to my girlfriend's place (after renting two movies -- one
whose name I can't remember but that had Bruce Willis and Michelle
Pfeiffer on the leading roles and
["The Matrix"](http://www.thematrix.com), which she hadn't seen)
and watched half a movie. Came home to (try to) sleep.
