Hi, Sebastian.

Yes, yes, I know that this "something" is the gstreamer infrastructure. :-) Just excuse my lack of abilities with English. I was so excited to have understood how the videos could be found with youtube-dl and push the release as soon as possible that I didn't think very much about the phrasing.

Anyway, that's great and I am using gstreamer with a lot of programs (and I am enjoying the gst123 command line program that Ahmed El-Mahmoudy uploaded and just got accepted from the NEW queue).

Thanks for your job, BTW.
