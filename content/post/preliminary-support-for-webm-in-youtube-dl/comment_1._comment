This "something" makes it possible to play or create WebM files in software that uses GStreamer. For example with epiphany-browser you'll be able to watch the WebM YouTube videos, transmageddon can create WebM files out of everything else, etc :)

(And of course GNOME's official media player totem can play the WebM files if gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad is installed)
