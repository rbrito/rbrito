Discovered a great site for using Usenet (instead of using
[Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/)): it's
[aioe.org](http://www.aioe.org/), which provides a nice opportunity
for those interested in serious discussions. What a terrific piece
of news!

I'm installing (at this *very* moment) a subset of
[TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive) for
[Debian](http://www.debian.org/). Let's see how it works compared
to the (already packaged) teTeX.
