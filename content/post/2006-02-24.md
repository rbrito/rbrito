Still trying to learn about digital photography. The subject is
fascinating. Too bad that I lack subjects to take pictures from,
but I guess that this is where the "artistic" part comes in.

Of course, the is also the "science" part of the thing, which is
where the knowledge comes in: choosing exposure, knowing what
lenses you should (or should not) use, seeing the appropriate flash
light settings etc.

Unfortunately, many things are written in market-speak and it is
almost impenetrable for a layman to know exactly what is being
talked about.

I upgraded
[the firmware](ftp://ftp.matrox.com/pub/mga/archive/bios/2005/setup_258.exe)
of my [Matrox](http://www.matrox.com/)
[G400](http://www.matrox.com/mga/support/user_manuals/mill_g400/home.cfm)
card to version 2.1.

Oh, I didn't know why my students were all excited to go home until
I realized that today was the first day of 2006's carnival.
