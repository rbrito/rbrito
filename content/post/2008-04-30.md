Upgraded my parent's computer from
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)'s Feisty (7.10) to Hardy (8.04).
Now, some of the things that I'm used to when using
[Debian](http://www.debian.org/)'s sid are available on their
computer.

Oh, I can't avoid to use this opportunity to complain once more
about my [ISP](http://www.flash.net.br/). If I weren't doing the
upgrade **really** early in the morning, I wouldn't have success,
as I am (right now), without signal from them. These outages are
getting on my nerves.

In some math related news, I finally saw a proof of the intuitive
fact the determinant of a 2x2 matrix is the signed area of the
parallelogram with vectors given by the column vectors of the
matrix.

Also, my D-Link G122 (I think that that's the model) doesn't work
with the `rt2500usb` driver that ships with the distribution: I can
see that `iwconfig` lists `wlan0` as having wireless extensions, I
can set the device, it can see the access point, I can enter the
WEP key, but it doesn't seem to get a DHCP lease from the router.
