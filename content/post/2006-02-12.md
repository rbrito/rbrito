Holy, shit! What a disasterous day: two car accidents in just one
day, mostly due to wandering around unknown and rainy places at
night (almost lost). This will cost me a good deal.

And, to boot it, my heart had an accident too. Oh.

On the bright side of things, teTeX 3.0 has entered testing, which
means quite a handful of new features and packages.
