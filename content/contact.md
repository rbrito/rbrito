# Contacting Me

You can contact me by many ways.

If you are reporting issues or looking for assistance with some of the
software that I write/wrote, then I would kindly ask you to send your
message via some forums/fora where not only me, but also other users of the
software can see your message (and you can get a faster reply).

This most likely means that you should report bugs via [GitHub][1].

If you are reporting a bug specific to the packages that I maintain on
Debian, then I would prefer if you used the [`reportbug` tool][2].

If you just want to send a quick message, then, please send it to [my
Twitter account][3], since it is probably the fastest way for me to answer
to something.

Using my [Telegram account][4] is also a very good way to reach me.

Lastly, you can reach me via email.
