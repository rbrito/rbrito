Slept a good amount (but not sufficient) and then I went to
recreate my debian-local repository. I ended up reshaping two
packages: checkpasswd and serialmail. I didn't do a very good job,
but, then, I'm only making those things for my own consumption
(which means that I'm not really keeping up to date with all the
lintian warnings).

I am also converting some more videos from MPEG-1 format to MPEG-4
ASP (DX50) mode. This time, I started with
[Megadeth](http://www.megadeth.com/)'s
[Woodstock'99](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock_1999)
concert. It had considerable image noise, and, to reduce the
bitrate, I had to use quite a strong noise filtering with
[mencoder](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/)'s `hqdn3d`.
