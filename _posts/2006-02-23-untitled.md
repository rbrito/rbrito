Learning a bit more regarding photography in general. For instance,
now I know the difference between
*[Slow Synchro](http://www.storyphoto.com/journalism/phototip_nine.html) ("nighttime")*
and
*[Fill](http://www.storyphoto.com/journalism/phototip_five.html) ("forced")*
flash. It will be nice to be able to use them both when the
situations arise.

A student of mine has lent me his "Towers of Hanoi" puzzle so that
I can teach recursion for some students. The fact that recursion
works so well for some cases seems to be surprising (like
[magic](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) or wizardry, sometimes) for
some students. They are not used to simple and elegant solutions to
some problems.

Thank you very much, Victor!
