Today I'm turning up one year more. The good side of that it is a
"psychological barrier" to evaluate what I've done this past year.
Well, it was actually mildly positive. Contributed to many
(diverse) programs, reported a handful of bugs and, generally, made
things go better the way I like it.

I have also spent some time to evangelize people that has, in turn,
evangelized some other people regarding Free Software. This is
good.

In summary, the whole year had its up and downs, but I think that
it had more ups than downs.
