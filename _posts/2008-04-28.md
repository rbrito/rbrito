Actually got [LAME](http://lame.sf.net/) compiling. I sent earlier
a patch to Robert to fix the compilation with
[libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/). This new
version of LAME is getting quite good. I think that soon we will
have the 3.98 release out there and maybe it is time for me to get
the debian directory in shape.
