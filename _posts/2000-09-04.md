Wow, what a day! I'm getting a bit older today. Some kind people
have sent me some cards (and some e-cards).

After the day began that way, I was pleased to learn that my
September issue of [Linux Journal](http://www.linuxjournal.com)
arrived.

Then, it was so nice to see a birthday present in form of a new
kernel ([Linux 2.2.17](http://www.linux.com)) being released.
Hopefully it will make the feedback and VM system a bit easier on
the user (now, I just need
[André Hedrick's IDE](http://www.linux-ide.org) patch and
[Reiser FS](http://devlinux.net/namesys/) ported to 2.2.17). And
there's the news that [KDE](http://www.kde.org) may be packaged to
[Debian](http://www.debian.org), now that Qt is being dually
licensed, which is übercool.

The day is not over yet and I just got my glasses fixed and now I
can see the world much clearer. Uh... If all days were like
this...
