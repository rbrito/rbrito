Just when I thought that I had enough things to play with, I
discovered some great tools on the 'net.

The first of this (and what consumed me a good amount of time) is
[pkfix-helper](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/pkfix-helper/),
an auxiliary script for
[pkfix](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/pkfix/) that
guesses the fonts used by old PostScript documents generated by
dvips with fonts that are scalable and that are much better to
transform to PDF format than bitmapped fonts. I even got some time
to write about [pkfix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pkfix) so that
people get a better idea of what it is all about (the previous
version of the document was quite bad).

Another tool that I've been playing with are mind-mappers. One from
KDE (which I can't recall right now) and one implemented in Java,
called [Freemind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/). Using those
tools is quite fun and you also get a better idea of what you have
to do (say, using them as a task planner). Interesting stuff.

I just don't understand why it is listed in
[Debian](http://www.debian.org/)'s contrib section, while it is
Free Software and its dependencies seem to be fulfiled with Free
Software only (remember that Java has, now, Free virtual
Machines).
