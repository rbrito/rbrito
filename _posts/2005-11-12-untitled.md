Stop the presses! If there is any text editor that would be worth
working with, that is [GNU Emacs](http://www.emacswiki.org/). The
version in [Debian](http://www.debian.org/)'s
[unstable](http://www.debian.org/releases/unstable/) (aka
[emacs-snapshot](http://packages.debian.org/emacs-snapshot)) is
absolutely amazing. Some small (but nice) improvements that I could
grasp with just five minutes of use of emacs-snapshot in comparison
to Emacs 21 are:

* It works out of-the-box with many control revision systems. In
  particular, it works *well* with subversion with the standard C-x
  v-v for check-in/check-out of the repositories.
* It sems to work better with modes like AUCTeX, with something
  closer to WYSIWYG, but still faithful to the LaTeX usage cycle.
* It seems to have better [UTF-8](http://www.unicode.org/)
  support, which means that I may, finally, forget about using
  anything else (like iso-8859-1). Now, I'm only waiting for
  [Mutt-ng](http://mutt-ng.berlios.de/) to reach testing and I will
  be a happier man. I may even start using the
  [latex-ucs](http://packages.debian.org/latex-ucs) package to encode
  everything that I type in Unicode.
* The font-locking mode works better and for more modes.
  Absolutely sweet.
* The new Emacs version is also available with use of
  [GTK 2.0](http://www.gtk.org/), which is much more beautiful than
  other toolkits used in the past. Also, as the same libraries are
  shared among other applications, there is a slight chance of
  observing lower memory footprint in some areas.
* Maybe it's just me, but using dired mode is now much easier. I
  always feared using emacs as a file manager, but now it seems to be
   a feasible alternative.

And I see that there is much more to learn. I feel that I have
barely scratched the surface of Emacs 22. Stay tunned kids. It will
surprise you, honest!

Oh, and using
[docbook-utils](http://packages.debian.org/docbook-utils) is indeed
a possibility instead of using passivetex. But typing everything in
XML is painful. Perhaps there is a mode for Emacs for working with
DocBook files? I'd be pleased to know.
