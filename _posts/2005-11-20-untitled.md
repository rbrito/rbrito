I'm *so* impressed with the
[recent improvements](http://packages.debian.org/emacs-snapshot-gtk)
in [GNU](http://www.gnu.org/) [Emacs](http://www.emacswiki.org/)
that I am sincerely considering using it as my "default operating
system".

Many people say that joking, but the new features along with a more
user-friendly, really make that an interesting option.

I use, by the way, the following extra packages from
[Debian](http://www.debian.org/):

    rbrito@dumont:~$ COLUMNS=88 dpkg -l | grep -- -el
    ii  debian-el        26.3-1           Emacs helpers specific to Debian users
    ii  emacs-goodies-el 26.3-1           Miscellaneous add-ons for Emacs
    ii  gettext-el       0.14.5-2         Emacs po-mode for editing .po files
    ii  post-el          2004.07.23-2     emacs major mode for editing mail
    rbrito@dumont:~$
