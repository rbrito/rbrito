Wow! The good news have not stopped! Another amazing thing: the
legendary book
*"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"* by Hal
Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Julie Sussman is **entirely**
available on-line at
[MIT Press Site](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html).

Not only that, but there are
[also videos of the classes taught in 1986](http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/)
by the authors themselves and they are definitely worth the
download.
