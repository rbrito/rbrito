Since the new teTeX has entered testing, I am playing with fonts.
Just
(re)-[discovered](http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?introduction=yes)
that the Base35 set is already packaged in a neat way. The
available fonts are:

* `avant`: uses AvantGarde for sans-serif fonts
* `courier`: uses Courier for constant-size fonts
* `times`: uses Times for proportional-size fonts (superceded by
  `mathptmx`)
* `palatino`: uses Palatino for proportional-size fonts (superceded
  by `mathpazo`)
* `newcent`: uses New Century Schoolbook for proportional-size
  fonts
* `helvet`: uses Helvetica for proportional-size fonts
