Today I got myself a new bootleg, from Opeth's current tour. I
haven't had time to actually listen to it, but it sounds good so
far (obviously, it is just an audience recording -- no soundboard
quality expected).

I also took away some
[bureacratic requirements](http://www.fenix.usp.br/) regarding my
course.

And today is my students' "mid-term". Let's see how they fare at
that.
