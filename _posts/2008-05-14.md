Didn't sleep too much today (2nd day in a row!), since I was
watching one of the
[Dream Theater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Theater)'s
[official bootlegs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Theater#Bootleg_culture),
"When Dream and Day Reunite". (It was *cold!* in the morning).

But this was after I spent a very good amount of time
[Debian](http://www.debian.org/)-packaging the upstream source code
of [LAME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAME) (to which I have
[CVS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System)
[commit access](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commit_(data_management))).
It now passes almost every
[lintian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lintian) check, besides the
fact that the `config.sub` and `config.guess` scripts have
time-stamps in the year of 2003. But I am not changing that (yet).

Now I am using my own dog-food, instead of relying on Christian
Marillat's precompiled versions of lame. And I even provided some
compatibility/transitional packages, so that packages like his
[ffmpeg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ffmpeg) with the newer and nicest
improvements of [LAME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAME) (like
fractional
[variable bitrate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_bitrate)
qualities).

This means, in particular, that I can use better
[MP3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3) sounding tracks for
videos.

And the good news is that, according to
[Hydrogenaudio](http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/), there is finally a
release of the lossy (but almost non-lossy!) compressor for audio
streams, called
[lossyWAV](http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=LossyWAV).
It surely seems quite promising.

Oh, and I finally discovered that the last show to which I went was
a looong time ago:
[Monsters of Rock Festival, September 24 1998](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsters_of_Rock#1998_3).
I was there to see Dream Theater, Megadeth, and Slayer, but some of
the people that were with me didn't like Slayer, unfortunately and
they wanted to exit the venue after I negotiated that I was there
to listen to, at least, "Raining Blood". Oh, Manowar was a joke.
Hilarious. I don't know if they take themselves seriously or not,
but they were ridiculous. This was the first time where I thought
of writing a program with a stochastic grammar to generate lyrics
for such stereotyped metal.
