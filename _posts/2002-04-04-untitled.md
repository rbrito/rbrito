How can life change so quickly from bad to good? Amazing, ain't it?
Had a great time at my SO's place. It was nice to see her get
happier, which made *me* happier.

It was nice to talk to [my advisor](http://www.ime.usp.br/~jose/)
and see that he (mostly) likes my work. Oh, how I needed those
positive, encouraging comments from him.

Found [Dream Theater](http://www.dreamtheater.net/)'s bootleg at
Beacon, with the full version of "Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence",
on my usual FTP server. New music. Good.

Now, [KDE 3.0](http://www.kde.org/) is finally launched. It looks
so amazing that I can't believe my eyes (err, the
[screenshots](http://kde.org/screenshots/kde300shots.html)). A big
plus for me is the built-in support for
[WebDAV](http://www.webdav.org/), which is used by
[Apple](http://www.apple.com/)'s
[iTools' iDisk](http://www.mac.com/).

In other news, it seems that [Megadeth](http://www.megadeth.com/)
is no more. Quite sad, as I like(d) them.

And [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/) 641d, the last version
before the 1.0 release, is
[already available](http://lists2.suse.com/archive/suse-ppc/2002-Mar/0079.html)
for [PPC/Linux](http://www.debian.org/ports/powerpc/). By the way,
OpenOffice is a Free and free alternative for Microsoft's Office.
It is also available for Microsoft Windows.

And a new version of [Blackdown](http://www.blackdown.org/)'s Java
is available for Linux, including PPC.
