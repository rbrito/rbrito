I was super sad to know that [[!wikipedia Paco de Lucia]] passed a few days
ago. It was shocking to know that he was so young (only 66 year old, if I am
not mistaken).

To share some of his fine work with his frequent collaborators
[[!wikipedia John McLaughlin]] and [[!wikipedia Al Di Meola]] to people that
may not otherwise know him or his work, I offered on a Facebook post to
upload a bootleg of a show of the Guitar Trio (John McLaughlin, Paco De
Lucia and Al Di Meola) with the entire performance (possibly out of order,
as that is a bootleg, after all) ripped from a broadcast to Dutch TV
station.

This performance includes the exceptional Paco de Lucia prominently and the
show has many songs from the "[[!wikipedia Friday Night in San Francisco]]"
record, including the magnificent (IMVHO)
"[[!wikipedia Mediterranean Sundance]]".

The credits of the video are, of course, of the musicians.

I only ripped, deinterlaced (remember, analog TV&mdash;it was interlaced),
denoised, encoded, and [uploaded the video to youtube][1].
