I also updated my package of `avr_evtd` (which is a daemon for
controlling the
[Kuro Box](http://kurobox.com/revolution/what.html). I moved from
the standard `diff.gz` package to a
[quilt](http://packages.debian.org/quilt)-based package.

To get things properly packaged, I followed the rules by the book
and used `/usr/share/quilt/quilt.make` to make available the
`patch` and `unpatch` targets for the makefile.

A very nice discussion on [IRC](irc://irc.debian.org/) on
`#debian-mentors` clarified that, with the current templates of
[dh-make](http://packages.debian.org/dh-make), we need to (thanks
to Sune Vuorela for his helpful comments):

* make the `configure` target depend on `$(QUILT_STAMPFN)`.
* make the `clean` target depend on `unpatch`.

The final "product" was uploaded to
[mentors](http://mentors.debian.net/) and is available for
sponsoring. And I intend to merge the modifications upstream
(actually, refactor a lot of things and possibly *become*
upstream).
