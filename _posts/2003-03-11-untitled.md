Woke up without sleeping as much as I wanted. Fine.

Wrote yet another bit about HMMs for the last chapter of my
Master's work. This time it was about the training process of a HMM
and the Baum-Welch algorithm. It seems to make perfect sense, even
if you haven't seen the proof that it is a special case of the EM
algorithm. It also seems to be slow.

I typed what I wrote.

And [sarge](http://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) is being updated
again. Hooray
