Was added as a project admin for
[`ppc-evtd`](http://sf.net/projects/ppc-evtd) and released version
1.7.3 of `avr-evtd`. Quite nice to see things evolving. `:-)`

Also updated the [freshmeat](http://freshmeat.net/) page of
[LAME](http://lame.sf.net/) to list version
[3.98.2](http://freshmeat.net/projects/lame/?branch_id=5469&release_id=285330).
Nice to be useful to the community.
