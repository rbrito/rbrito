So, we had this Christmas dinner here at home with my mother's
grandma, two uncles and an aunt.

Grandma wanted to see Bram Stoker's "Dracula", but she was asleep
right there in the first few moments...

Oh, I'm still encoding the MIT videos. This time it seems that
everything will fit onto exactly one Dual-Layer DVD+R.
