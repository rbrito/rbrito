After installing the NewerTech G3 upgrade card into the PowerMac 9500/180MP,
I had some problems, when I tried to install
[Debian](http://www.debian.org/).

None of the sarge floppies would work and I eventually decided to get rid of
any traces of MacOS and installed using the woody floppies. The problem is
that the kernel 2.2.20 that comes with woody ins't able to see both PCI
buses, especially the one where the video card is sitting on. I had to grab
a kernel from testing's repository, but I don't like distribution kernels,
for they are way too bloated.

Note to self: when replacing the `zImage` on the HFS boot floppy, one
has to use the vmlinux image compressed with `gzip`, like this:

    gzip -9 vmlinux
    hmount /dev/fd0
    hcopy vmlinux.gz :zImage
    humount /dev/fd0

No other image that I tried worked. But it was nice to (re)-discover how one
makes a boot floppy for an OldWorld Mac.

P.S.: Today, [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) announced the next upgrade of
[MacOS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/), code named "Tiger".
