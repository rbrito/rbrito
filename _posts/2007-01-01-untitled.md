A new year, with a little bit of wine. I don't want this to sound
like a "New Year's Resolution", but I sincerely hope to have more
time to study combinatorial things.

Being in my "alma mater" is a nice way to get the year started and
with contact with [some](http://www.ime.usp.br/~pf/)
[very](http://www.ime.usp.br/~etengan/)
[nice](http://www.ime.usp.br/~tausk/)
[friends](http://www.ime.usp.br/~lymber/), I'll hope to get the
ball rolling for the rest of the year.
