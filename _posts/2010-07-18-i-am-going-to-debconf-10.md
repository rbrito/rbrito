I just bought my tickets today to NYC and I am glady to say that I am going to Debconf 10.

The tickets have this information:
<ul>
	<li><strong>GRU-&gt;JFK:</strong> Departure: 2010-07-30, 21:25; Arrival: 2010-07-31, 6:10, Flight AA950</li>
	<li><strong>JFK-&gt;GRU:</strong> Departure: 2010-08-09, 21:40; Arrival: 2010-08-10, 8:35, Flight AA951</li>
</ul>
This represents a personal milestone for me, as I have many plans for the conference. In fact, this will be a trip of many "firsts" for me:
<ul>
	<li>this will be my first international trip by airplaine.</li>
	<li>this will be my first DebConf ever (despite the fact that I could not apply for the <a href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2010/04/the_DebConf_Newbies_initiative/">DebConf Newbies initiative</a>, due to my visa interview being delayed until the 7th of this month).</li>
	<li>this will be the first time to see many people with whom I work together for some years now, but have not yet had the opportunity to meet in person.</li>
	<li>this will be a nice opportunity to work hard on <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/396079/">some issues that threaten the PowerPC port</a> of Debian.</li>
	<li>this will be a nice opportunity to do some QA work with some packages that I would like to have sponsored; also to <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/551955">upload</a> some of the <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/580005">fonts</a> that I <a href="http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-fonts/ttf-paratype-sans.git">already packaged</a> (or <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/581839">intend</a> to <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/589094">take care</a>) and that will be maintained under the <a href="http://pkg-fonts.alioth.debian.org/">Debian Fonts Task Force umbrella</a>.</li>
	<li>this will be a very nice opportunity to get myself in a "big" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component">strongly connected component </a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">Web-of-Trust</a> with as many arcs as feasible, by means of the <a href="http://people.debian.org/~anibal/ksp-dc10/ksp-dc10.html">key signing party.</a></li>
	<li>and many, many other things that I would like to do for the project.</li>
</ul>
I am thankful for the DebConf team sponsoring both accomodation and food.  It is highly appreciated.

See you in NYC! Any hints that you may happen to have are warmly welcome.
