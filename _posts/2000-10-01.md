Watched a tiny bit of the men marathon up to the point were the
African athletes won. This made me sleepy all the day. To make
matters worse, I woke up many times today. Noisy neighbors.

Election day today. It's funny that I thought I'd have problems
standing in huge lines, but it seems that computers can indeed be
helpful to humanity. Everything was fast and no annoyances. I'm
impressed.

Tomorrow may be a sad day for [Napster](http://www.napster.com).
Like they say,
["Hope for the best, prepare for worst"](http://gnutella.wego.com).
This may mean that my ADSL may not be as useful as I'd like it to
be...
