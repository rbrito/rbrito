Having been playing with some new things in
[Debian](http://www.debian.org/), like the
[`magicfilter`](http://packages.debian.org/magicfilter) package,
which is a superb, lightweight solution to all my printing
problems: to use a PCL 3 printer. I think that I will also
"manufacture" a solution with a metapackage of a live CD that
includes the environment that I use frequently, with the packages
that I use (this is probably quite leaner than what
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) has done with their distribution,
since I will mainly use some lighter packages).

Oh, talking about lighter packages, I see that Debian has adopted a
new C library, namely [EGLIBC](http://www.eglibc.org/), which
stands for Embedded LIBC. Finally, it seems that Debian will focus
a bit more on smaller systems (which is a good thing, because
computing resources are limited).
