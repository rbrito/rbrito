One good thing to have in mind is that when one is minimally
serious about data structures, then on covering the topic of
[hash tables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table), it is a
quite good chance to talk about the
["birthday paradox"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox).
In the analogy, each day would correspond to a slot in the hash
table and each person would correspond to an item to be inserted
into the table.

If one takes this into account, the analysis of
[collisions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox#Collision_counting)
is meaninful from a probabilistic point of view, which matters a
lot.

Changing the subject a little, in a replacement that lasted, say,
15 minutes (tops), the cable modem is back again working, which
means that playing with [tunneling](http://lartc.org/) under
[Linux](http://www.kernel.org/) (especially, using the IPSec
interface) is back again a possibility.

Oh, and it seems that [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntulinux.org)'s
[dapper](http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/releases) is "mom proof".
Well, at least, she has been learning to use it with some hiccups,
but, then, personal computers aren't things with which she plays
everyday. She was surprised to know about
[Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) and its broad coverage. And,
indeed, it is superb.
