I have finally succeed, with the help of RaphaÃ«l Hertzog, to use
the authenticated services of [Alioth](http://alioth.debian.org/)
for continuing work with the
[Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) on
[vrms](http://vrms.alioth.debian.org/).

In the mean time, I have received a lot of constructive criticism
from [Daniel Baumann](http://blog.daniel-baumann.ch/) for
improvements to [vrms](http://vrms.alioth.debian.org/) packaging.

I have been spending some time dealing with user support of
[Algorithms](http://algorithms.berlios.de/) and a new version may
see the light of the day quite soon, with some new features (e.g.,
the ability of starting the numbers of pseudo code arbitrarily, the
ability of specifying the size of font with which to typeset the
code and the feature of including the algorithms in the list of
figures).

I will soon update my "Curriculum Lattes" to reflect those latest
activities.
