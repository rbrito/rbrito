Since I maintain a Darwin partition on my system, I use
[GRUB legacy](http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub-legacy.en.html)
to choose which OS I want to play with. But, then, due some of my
tweaking, it stopped working. Ouch. Even if I selected it, it
wouldn't boot and would return to GRUB's menu. Irritating, to say
the least.

Being disappointed with that, I eventually,
[RTFM of GRUB](http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/)
and learned a bit more about something that seems to give
[hackintosh](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=107391)
users some headaches: the partition bootloader being foobared.

The solutions presented there are bizantine from a Unix P-o-V. The
necessary steps to fix it are just to:

1. Make sure that the **hard disk** bootloader (that is, the MBR
   of your HD) contains GRUB's `stage 1` loader.
   *Warning:* don't just `dd` it to your HD's file, so that your
   system can "forget" the partitions that you have.
2. Make sure that the **partition** bootloader (something that is
   peculiar to the x86 arches and which, I as a user of other
   platforms, didn't know that existed) is set to Apple's `boot1h`.
   This time, you can just `dd` it to the first sector of the
   partition where Darwin/MacOS X resides.
3. Teach GRUB to set its snippet to run Darwin with
   `root (hd0,0)` (or whatever partition contains Darwin), tell it
   to make the partition active with `makeactive`, and tell it to load
   the **partition** bootloader with `chainloader +1`.
4. (Optional) Edit
   `/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist` to
   contain the elements `<key>Kernel</key>`
   `<string>mach_kernel.foo</string>` to point to whatever is your
   kernel of choice.
5. (Optional) If you make changes under Linux, with the `hfsplus`
   module, it is highly recommended that you unmount your filesystem
   and run the `fsck.hfsplus` from the
   [hfsplus](http://packages.debian.org/hfsplus) package that I
   maintain in [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) (and which is mirrored
   by [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), but Debian's is more
   up-to-date, as I have uploads rights there).
6. (Optional)
   [Test it with QEMU](http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/testing-stuff-with-qemu-part-3-debian-gnu-kfreebsd),
   to see if it will work.

This was a nice learning exercise, to be honest.
