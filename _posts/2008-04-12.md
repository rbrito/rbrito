During he past few days, I have been writing (in
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/), of course!) some (very)
elementary notes on Elementary Number Theory, after starting to
read the classic book "Introduction to Number Theory", by Hardy &
Wright. The reasons for me taking such notes are threefold:

* To know how much I retained of the content of my studies and to
  serve as a reference for future for facts that I will surely
  forget.
* To provide a text that has a language different from the book,
  which, while quite good, uses old-fashioned terms (e.g., they use
  consistently the word "aggregate" for the word "set").
* To provide both some algorithmic aspects of Elementary Number
  Theory that are usually not covered in similar texts (while there
  is quite a lot of room for the computational side of things) and to
  provide multiple proofs (where I know them) of theorems, which
  serve to illuminate the understanding of facts and see connections
  with other fields.

Today I got a phone call from a *very* dear friend of mine. I
[sent her flowers and chocolate](http://www.floresonline.com.br/)
as a birthday gift.
