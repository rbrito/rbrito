Holy freaking day! Today we had
[the announcement](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html)
that [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) will be switching to
[Intel processors](http://www.intel.com). This is a major movement,
in my very humber opinion. Does this mean that all the claims about
PowerPC being more effective are not true anymore (well, that may
be the case with Power 970 processors, but G3 processors seem to be
quite nice regarding power comsumption).

As if that weren't enough news for one day,
[Debian](http://www.debian.org/) finally, after almost 3 (*three*)
years,
[released a new version of its distribution](http://www.debian.org/News/2005/20050606),
codenamed sarge. This is the major news for the day (and for the
month, if you ask me).

And like if that weren't enough, Linus Torvalds also
[announced kernel 2.6.12-rc6](http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.12-rc6.bz2),
which is (hopefully) one of the final stages towards kernel 2.6.12
proper.
