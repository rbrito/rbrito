Woohoo! Got Debian's XFree86 4.0.1 packaged for potato. It's faster
with my Trident 3D Im√†ge 975 than XFree86 3.3.6, because it uses
more hardware acceleration (in fact, this was the main reason I
tried to find it).

Of course, it couldn't be a painless experience.

For configuration, dexter didn't work (it died reproducibly when I
was configuring it) and xf86cfg didn't work (I can't remember the
reason why it didn't work). So, I was "forced" to use X's internal
autoprobing. But then, my old, 2-button, serial mouse couldn't be
used with 3 button emulation. It took me a lot of time to figure
out how to do that (since the documentation -- both man pages and
extra documents -- don't mention it). After some painful hours,
I've discovered the magical line \`Option "Emulate3Buttons"'. It
then worked.

But then, there were remaining problems: some dock WindowMaker
utilities were removed when I installed the new X (due to
dependendy problems). I had to recompile them. Then, rxvt was
strange. Recompile time again.

Now, everything seems fine. Another thing to throw on that "extras"
CD.
