I was with some spare time a few days ago and I took one of those stupid
tests that are so popular in the Internet. Well, here are the results,
saying that I am, indeed, a Geek, which does not surprise me that much. :)

I did expect my Math score to be higher than everything else (I'm only in
the 90th percentile with respect to this), while I am high on the Computer
side of things (in the 97th percentile).

I guess that I should devote myself to more Mathematics and writing less
code. :)
