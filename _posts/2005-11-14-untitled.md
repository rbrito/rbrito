I think that I reached a point of balance between the minimality of
programs in my system and the functionality that I desire.
Actually, I would expect a little more functionality (perhaps
provided by the ROX project).

But now I can work without fear of loosing data, thanks to
[mondo rescue](http://packages.debian.org/mondo), which is able to
backup the essential parts of my system in just one CD-RW. Nice
this sensation of being backed up.
