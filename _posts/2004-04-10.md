The more I use the combo [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) and
[Emacs](http://www.emacswiki.org/), the more I like them. It is
amazing how much complexity they have below their surface and how
much they can accomplish. Unfortunately, I still don't know enough
to call myself neither a LaTeX literate nor a Emacs literate, but I
sure hope to fill the holes in my education soon.

One package that I recently discovered for Emacs is
[ECB](http://ecb.sf.net/), which provides many of the features
found in other development programs, like Microsoft's Visual
Studio. And the included speedbar (and the newer speedbar-beta,
already included in [Debian](http://www.debian.org/)'s
[sarge](http://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) is amazing.

Also amazing are the packages
[preview-latex](http://preview-latex.sf.net/),
[AUCTeX](http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/) and
[RefTeX](http://zon.astro.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools/reftex/). They all
make life with [TeX](http://www.tug.org/) and
[Emacs](http://www.emacswiki.org/) much easier.
