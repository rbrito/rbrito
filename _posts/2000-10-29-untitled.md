Today is election day again (the city where I live had a second
turn of elections) and surprisingly computers have helped again. I
thought the only thing they did was take our free time. It took me
less than one minute to vote and I didn't stand in line for hours.
Something must be wrong.

I also kept downloading more things from Napster. And my 13GB HD is
almost completely full. I guess that I'm obessed with broadband.
