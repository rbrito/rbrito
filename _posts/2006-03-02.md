Nice. Let's see if this MathML thing works as intended:
<math xmlns="&mathml;">
  <mfrac>
    <mi>a</mi>
    <mi>b</mi>
  </mfrac>
</math>

Well, actually, it does. But only after I changed the extension of
the file from html to xhtml. What a crazy thing is this? What is
the purpose of that damned XML header on this file? Isn't it to
tell the damn server that this is an XML file? I suppose that the
server here may be broken.

Oh, and talking about broken things, my
[cable modem](http://www.flash.net.br/) just got fried after
today's thunderstorm. Wow. Nice to have a backup plan.
