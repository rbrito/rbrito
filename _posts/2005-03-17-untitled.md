So, now I am officially a maintainer of the
[algorithms](ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/algorithms.html)
package, which makes me quite happy. Many thanks go to the previous
maintainer, Peter Williams, for creating such a great piece of
software.

Also, it seems that finally [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/) has
understood that the scientific community uses Unix and they have
released
[Acrobat/Adobe Reader 7.0](ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/unix/7x/7.0/enu/)
for Linux, with widgets with [Gtk 2.0](http://www.gtk.org/). Tr√©s
cool.

BTW, I have stopped reading on Graph Theory just for a tiny bit to
learn things on Abstract Algebra. I want to study algebraic
properties of graphs and, for that, I have to get my rusty algebra
in shape. Also, some Linear Algebra wouldn't hurt.
