Had the pleasant experience of watching "Constantine". The
comparisons with "The Exorcist" are obvious here, even though this
one is a nice movie. BTW, it seems that after the Matrix series,
Keanu Reeves is doomed to Sci-Fi movies with lots of special
effects. It's not a bad thing, nor a good thing. Just an
observation.

*Trivia:* It was a pleasant surprise to see (humm, hear actually)
that David Brubeck's Quarted "Take Five" was on the soundtrack. Oh,
and they insist on putting a
[PowerBook](http://www.apple.com/powerbook/) on the movie. That is
simply tempting. This is not the first movie that I see where
something made by [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) appears on the big
screen.

Of course, going to the supermarket after the movie was also quite
nice, if you know what I mean. And the pleasant company was also
highly appreciated. It couldn't be much better that this (really).
