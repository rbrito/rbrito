Holy moly! Things now seem to be going! I'm quite happy with all
this.

First of all, I clearead all the bugs in
[`hfsprogs`](http://packages.debian.org/hfsprogs), including a
[very long standing bug](http://bugs.debian.org/436159) in Apple's code
that prevented me from compiling everything in 64-bits.

Now, the package compiles under all arches, which is amazingly great. I also
took the opportunity to [tell
Apple](http://lists.apple.com/archives/Darwin-userlevel/2009/Nov/msg00004.html)
that I have patches that I want to push upstream. Let's see if they are
indeed open to collaboration.

I'm learning to use the marvellous
[`quilt`](http://packages.debian.org/quilt) to clean up some code of
others. With a bit of discipline, things get quite easy to work with. A
good tool can, indeed, make one's job much easier.

Oh, an TeXlive 2009 was *just* uploaded to experimental, which
means that it will soon reach unstable. I am already using it and
it is quite nice (actually, I've been using it for a bit longer
than this, but the fact is that it is now available everywhere).
Thanks Norbert, Frank, Hilmar and Co.

On some other news, I am now maintaining "my" version of two nice
packages:

* [Amarok 1.4](http://amarok.kde.org/), which, although abandoned
  upstream, is much more useful (and lighter on resources) than
  Amarok 2. I have updated it with some patches and things are much
  nicer.
* [grip](http://packages.debian.org/grip), a very nice CD ripper,
  which seems to be dead upstream, but which has some good patches
  that are extremely easy to integrate. Coincidentally,
  [Christian Marillat](http://www.debian-multimedia.org/) has, one
  day after I started working on grip, packaged a version to put in
  his repository. I think that we could join some forces maintaining
  it.

Oh, and the biggest news of all: writing manpages is easier than
ever. I always edited Perl's pod files as a way to avoid writing
`*roff` code directly and using the pod source to generate the
manpages. But I used Emacs's Perl mode. This way, Emacs shows the
pod source as a comment, without recognizing the structure of the
files. That's not a problem anymore. Russ Allbery just hinted me at
the fact that Emacs offers a pod-mode. Amazing.
