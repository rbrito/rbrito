After a long time without updates, I'm now back to "work".
[Steve Vai](http://www.vai.com) is making some concerts here in SÃ£o
Paulo, but unfortunately, I didn't attend it (the tickets' prices
were a bit on the steep side) and as I've just bought myself a new
new computer (woohoo), I'm saving a bit of money.

My new machine is a virgin [AMD](http://www.amd.com) Duron 600MHz,
with an [Asus](http://www.asus.com) A7V motherboard (which, among
other things, includes an UDMA/100 controller, FSB frequency
controls and multiplier control), 128MB of SDRAM/PC133, a great
[Matrox](http://www.matrox.com) G400 card (monohead) with 16MB of
SGRAM and a [Samsung](http://www.samsung.com) HD of 40GB.

I'm actually quite excited and aside from some problems that I had
with a defective Matrox (that I've now returned), it's working
wonderfully. It's so good that it even runs
[Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org) quite fast! I can't wait for
[KDE](http://www.kde.org) 2.0.1 to be released on Monday (Dec 4th)
so that I can try the latest incarnation of
[Konqueror](http://www.konqueror.org).

BTW, [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org) 2.8 was released today and
I've already downloaded a copy and burned onto CD. I think that
I've made everything right to get a bootable CD, but the CD that
I've made is only able to boot in my new computer. Strange.

And speaking of BSD, I also have [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org)
4.2-RELEASE downloaded and burned. In fact, I think that I'm
spending way too much time with this Internet thing (I downloaded
FreeBSD the very same day it was released -- that's Nov 21st).
