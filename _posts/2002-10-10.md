The BBC has a nice article about evolution. Of humans.
[Here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2190461.stm).

Some time ago, I found this nice argument (on
[Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/)) for why people should use
[OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/) instead of Microsoft's
Office suite:

> "I see you're still using traditional software on your computer,
> Bob. Don't you know that stuff is susceptible to Microsoft Outlook
> viruses? Have you tried Openoffice? It's free! It's free because it
> is developed using a leading-edge development method that's
> superior to the old-fashioned way that Microsoft develops software.
> Microsoft software is expensive because the conventional methods
> they use to create it are inefficient. That's why there are so many
> Microsoft viruses around. There aren't any OpenOffice viruses. Why
> don't you give it a try?"
