Oh, my! I stayed up to 7am without any sleep to get the card to do
just a sucky 1024x768x16bits with a similarly bad refresh rate. And
the card is sloooow. Or so it seems. But
[Google](http://www.google.com) tells me other people are also
having problems with it, which makes me a little bit more
comfortable (at least I'm not going nuts thinking that I'm
consistently making stupid mistakes -- which are more common than
what I'd like to admit).
