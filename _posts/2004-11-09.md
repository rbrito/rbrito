What a strange year this one has been. I was almost killed today in
a car accident. Modulo some pain and the lack of a car, everything
is fine right now. But I wished that everything were slightly
different.

On the good news front,
[Firefox 1.0](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) was
released today, which is one of the most anticipated software
releases of the year. Nice to counter-balance the other bad news.

I also updated [my mini-tour](../latex/index.html) for making
presentations in LaTeX with PPower4.
