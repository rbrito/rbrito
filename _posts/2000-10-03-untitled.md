The telco company was supposed to install my ADSL (256kbits down,
128kbits up) today, but, alas, they didn't. Apparently, they had a
problem with their central and after the modem was installed, it
didn't see the other side. Needless to say, I was quite angry with
this.

The technician will be coming tomorrow morning to finish the
installation.
