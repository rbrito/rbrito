Went to the physician to see if I needed new glasses. Even her was
surprised when she saw the results of the tests: I will have to be
subject to more tests as what she saw wan't sufficient for a
decision: my right eye's retina may have some damage. I don't
know if I am happy about this result or not, but it finally seems
to be on track of being diagnosed.
