I guess that I should really take some time to experiment with
[OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org). If not for anything else, it
seems that the system is so well documented that I found a site
pointed by their FAQ with an on-line engine that generated a
Modeline for whooping 1024x768 @85Hz with the Trident card. I had
never really pushed my monitor that far. On the low side, it seems
the Trident card is made by some RIAA people and just generates
some noise when I'm playing some MP3s. Looking forward to see if X4
can help me with acceleration.
