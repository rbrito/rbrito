Due to some real life impediments (including a beautiful one with just over
2 months of life called Daniel), I will not be able to go to this year's
DebConf, even though it seems that this DebConf will exceed many
expectations with the support that the governement of Nicaragua just
offered.

# Things that I would like to have worked on

Unfortunately, this means that I will not be working with some fellows that
may be there, like people from the `pkg-multimedia` team.

In particular, as I am working on some packages that are not that well
suited to distributions (especially regarding [HandBrake][0]), it would be
highly productive to have a hacking session or two with other people
interested in having this popular and easy-to-use video ripper/transcoder on
Debian.

I would also like to be able to talk in person with other people (including
[Joey Hess][1]) about controversial packaging of some programs, like GNU
Parallel, [which I maintain in Debian][2].

There are many things else that I would love to work on, besides helping a
bit with some of the still pending transitions of the the
[Debian Fonts Task Force umbrella][3], meeting friends and other social
stuff.

Oh, well. I guess that working at home will be the solution for some time.
