I had a second meeting with a girl at a local shopping mall. The
initial plan was to go to the movies, but we spent so much time
chatting that the hours flied and we missed the movies. Bah, they
weren't that interesting anyway. What was interesting, though, was
spending some time in her car, talking about a number of things.
How pleasant it was! And her kisses are wonderful. I think that I'm
falling in love.
