Didn't sleep too much today (actually I spent the whole night awake
trying to understand the simple program presented on
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/) for the generation of the
[Farey Series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_series) (as Hardy
& Wright call them). Finally, looking at my copy of
["Concrete Mathematics"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics),
I discovered a "bonus problem" (read: a very hard problem) that has
a deceivingly simple solution that I was looking for the past few
days to justify the program correctness.

Latter, I went with my dad to "Galeria do Rock" to grab myself a
copy of
[Pain of Salvation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_of_Salvation)'s
"Be" (DVD+CD),
[Tristania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristania_(band))'s
"Widow's Weeds" and "Beyond the Veil", and
[Opeth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opeth)'s
["Deliverance"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliverance_(Opeth_album)).
