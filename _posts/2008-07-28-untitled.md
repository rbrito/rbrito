Got a little new toy that is able to run Linux very well, since I
brought with me two [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) Live CDs (of
version 8.04 LTS).

It features a Core 2 Duo T7250 processor. It has support for its
1.3 Megapixel webcam out-of-the-box, since the webcam uses the the
[USB device Video Class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_video_device_class)
protocol. The only problem is that I don't know how to use mencoder
to grab a video from it. And its speakers sound is **so** quiet. Way
too much quiet, even at maximum volume.

The [macbook](http://www.apple.com/macbook/) that I saw used things
from Broadcom, which is not a company that likes Free Software.
