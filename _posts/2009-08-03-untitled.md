These past days I have been
[crushing some bugs](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?maint=rbrito@ime.usp.br)
in [Debian](http://www.debian.org/)'s
[sid](http://www.debian.org/releases/sid).

Two things motivated me to get my acts together:

* the recent decision to adopt
  [time-based freezes](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases) in
  Debian;
* the upcoming release of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)'s
  [Karmic Koala](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases).

As can be seen from the list, there is quite a sizeable amount of
work to be done---this is what one gets for adopting otherwise
orphaned packages or packages that have moderately sized audiences.
But, on the other hand, it is also pleasant to get the software
moving (approximately) in the direction that I want.

I say approximately because the packages on which my packages
depend may have some un-wanted dependencies, which, in turn, will
still pull in some nasty amount of things that don't belong in a
system tuned to have small footprint (especially important for
netbooks, low-powered desktops, and embedded systems).

Oh, BTW, please note that time-based *releases* are not the same
thing as time-based *freezes*, even though what I provided is a
link for the time-based releases. The concepts are close, though.
