Having been playing with some new things in [Debian][0], like the
[[!debpkg magicfilter]] package, which is a superb, lightweight solution to
all my printing problems: to use a PCL 3 printer. I think that I will also
"manufacture" a solution with a metapackage of a live CD that includes the
environment that I use frequently, with the packages that I use (this is
probably quite leaner than what [Ubuntu][1] has done with their
distribution, since I will mainly use some lighter packages).

Oh, talking about lighter packages, I see that Debian has adopted a new C
library, namely [EGLIBC][2], which stands for Embedded LIBC. Finally, it
seems that Debian will focus a bit more on smaller systems (which is a good
thing, because computing resources are limited).
