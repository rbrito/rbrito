Due to the accident of yesterday, today I decided to take pictures
of my car, just as a proof of the damage made by mad freshmen.

A friend of mine has kindly helped with her camera and taking
pictures of the car. They are just scary. I just get the feeling
that I am living among wild, savage people.

And a neighbour of mine has kindly lent me his
[Samsung](http://www.samsung.com/)
[still camera](http://www.samsungcamera.com/) for me to take some
extra pictures, before going to the police. It is a Digimax A302,
with capacity of 3.2 megapixels.

I guess that, now, the
[Top Ten Digital Photography Tips](http://www.macdevcenter.com/lpt/a/2849)
will make more sense to me (along with reading the manual of the
camera). Oh, by the way, it worked fine with
[Linux](http://www.kernel.org/)
[2.6.16-rc3](http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.16-rc3.bz2)'s
mass storage module loaded. No extra drivers needed. Nice toy. And
a nice operating system too.
