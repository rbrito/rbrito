This blog is just a way to collect thoughts and discoveries regarding my use
of Free Software, Mathematics (it also includes some personal notes, of
course).  Some of the content here will be related to TeX (and siblings) and
some will be related to me hacking on some piece of software.

Rearding me, I am an Instructor of Computer Science at "Universidade
Presbiteriana Mackenzie", SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Currently, I am on absence for
health treatment. I am also a Debian Maintainer and I am *highly* interested
in Free Software, with Debian-based systems being my primary interest.
