This page is an excellent opportunity to "vent" some opinions. Some, quite trivial. Some observations. Things that I've learned about Mathematics (I hope to be "somebody" any day soon). Short or cool proofs that I discovered and that I wanted to publish (even though they may be well-known by the entire mathematical community).

And, again, opinions. Some of them, "forbidden" by other means or by "The Man".
