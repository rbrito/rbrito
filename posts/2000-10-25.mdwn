Tomorrow I'll have the "midterm" of Combinatorial Optimization.
It's not exactly a midterm, since it is considerably skewed towards
the end of the semester and I'll have 3 other tests until the
course is finished, but I guess that having this many tests is
actually better than having only two.

I'm terribly tired, sad (I'm not emotionally very well) and without
much motivation to study for my test. I have a reasonbly good grasp
of the theory, but some details of the subject didn't "sink in" up
till now and I'm not very much optimistic regarding what I can do
until tomorrow. In particular, finding negative cycles efficiently
(i.e., in polynomial time) is still a mystery for me. I have some
intuition of why the O(nm) algorithm works, but I have still to sit
down and write a complete, detailed a proof. I wish I had time.
