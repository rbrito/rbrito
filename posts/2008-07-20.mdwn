Just discovered that [Opeth](http://www.opeth.com/) (or would it be
[Roadrunner Records](http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/)?) has
released a version of
[Watershed with extra tracks and with a DVD documentary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_(Opeth_album)).
They have also released another special version that has
[Porcelain Heart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKx5zrb0Z_0)
played with [Mellotron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellotron)
(which brings orgasms to all the
[progressive rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock)
fans, like myself).

Also got my parents to sit in front of my old, trusty
[Duron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duron)-based `dumont` (in
honor of Brazilian pioneer
[Alberto Santos-Dumont](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos_Dumont)).
It is interesting to note that, while the Level 2
[cache](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache) of the Duron system
is small for a low-cost processor (in reference to its rival
[Celeron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeron) processor, that had
a bigger Level 2 cache), it has a much bigger
(128[KiB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KiB)) Level 1 cache than
what I have in a
[Pentium D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_D) machine: only
16KB for each core (at least for data; that's what my `dmesg`
says). Surprising to say the least. And this explains why
[AMD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD) stood on the front of the
race during the Athlon (Thunderbird) days.

Regarding other architectures (I have
[PowerPC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC) in mind here), I'm
not especially happy with them: my
[PowerPC G3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC_G3) lacks
[vector instructions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_processor),
which means that playing multimedia files (read: movies) is
something painful. The problem is that I **quite** like the iBook's
form factor and I have not yet seen anything that matches it yet.
Comments are welcome here. Yes, it seems that I am not alone here,
given all the frenziness about the surge of netbook computers, like
the [Eee PC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_PC).

And I setup my old sound gear on what is my main (desktop)
computer. It is nice to have a good sound whenever I am working
(well, whenever I am working lightly, as I need sound to be absent
when I'm working hard).

I have, BTW, just found a
[superb autotools tutorial](http://vindaci.members.sonic.net/cbreak/projects/autotools/)
that starts with the egregious `"Hello, World!"` application. This
is a perfect point for reading more advanced documents on this
matter.
