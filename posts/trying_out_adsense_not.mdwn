On the 3rd of September, I applied to Google's [AdSense][1] program, as I
told in my [previous post][2].

Well, that was a short-lived experience. On the 5th of September, I received
the following e-mail, which, sincerely, is as uninformative as it could get:

    Date: Wed, 05 Sep 2012 16:52:22 -0000
    From: adsense-noreply@google.com
    To: rbrito@gmail.com
    Subject: Google AdSense Support

    Hello,

    As mentioned in our welcome email, we conduct a second review of your
    AdSense application once AdSense code is placed on your site(s). As a
    result of this review, we have disapproved your account for the following
    violation(s):

    Issues:

    - Site does not comply with Google policies


    ---------------------

    Further detail:


    Site does not comply with Google policies: We're unable to approve your
    AdSense application at this time because we feel that your site does not
    comply with Google AdSense policies or webmaster quality guidelines. It's
    our goal to provide our advertisers sites that offer rich and meaningful
    content, receive organic traffic, and allow us to serve well-targeted ads
    to users. We believe that currently your site does not fulfill this
    criteria.

    For more details, please read the webmaster quality guidelines at
    http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=35769 and
    the AdSense program policies at
    http://support.google.com/adsense/bin/answer.py?answer=48182,
    https://support.google.com/adsense/bin/topic.py?topic=1271507

    (...)

OK, I went on and read **all** the documentation on program policies
etc.  I investigate each point here:

* Invalid clicks and impressions: No violation here.
* Encouraging clicks: No violation here.
* Content guidelines: No violation here.
* Copyrighted material: No violation here.
* Webmaster guidelines: No violation here.
* Traffic sources: No violation here.
* Ad behavior: No violation here.
* Ad placement: No violation here.
* Site behavior: No violation here.
* Competitive ads and services: No violation here.
* Google advertising cookies: No violation here.

To cut a long story short, I RTFM and did everything correctly. So, dear
lazyweb, what would my options be to fund a tiny bit of my software
contributions?
