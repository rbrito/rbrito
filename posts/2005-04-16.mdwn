I can't believe how 2.6 [kernels](http://www.kernel.org) are bigger
than 2.4 kernels under similar compilation options! Maybe it's time
to give [tiny-linux](http://www.selenic.com/tiny-about/) a try.

I will also see if compiling kernels with
[GCC 3.4](http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.4/) makes a difference due to
the new [-funit-at-a-time](http://lwn.net/Articles/67176/) option.
Debian's sarge "official" compiler seems to be
[GCC 3.3](http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.3/).

This machine is desperately in need of a memory upgrade, but it
seems that not even [Crucial](http://www.crucial.com) has it
available anymore. :-(
