Took the day to go to my uncle's computer shop and installed
[Debian GNU/Linux](http://www.debian.org) Potato (which is a beta
release with final release quality) for him with Helix Code's
[Gnome](http://www.helixcode.com). This is the n-th attempt at
converting him to see the light, but, for some reason, it appears
that he was not as scared as in the previous attempts. Since my
trustworthy S3 Trio64+ is giving signals of its age, I got a newer
Tridend 3DImage750 to substitute it.
