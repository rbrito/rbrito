Sorry for ignorance here, but the magnification that those tools would provide me would only be bitmapped, wouldn't they?

While I am typesetting with high quality fonts I need to see the curves, not jagged lines, since hinting/etc of the fonts may ruin the work.

If they do provide me with vectorial graphics, then I would love to know more about them. But the fact that no commonly used Free PDF reader allows me to zoom more than those 4x without being patched or with monstruously needed amounts of memory still stands.

I have provided (on those links) patches for both xpdf proper and epdfview. Trying to see HPA's document on RAID6 with a magnification of 3800% killed my computer. :-)
