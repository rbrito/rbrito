I can't believe, but I've packaged *all* those programs in just a
day. Granted, I was really tired when I finished and that was the
only thing I did today. But it was worth it, because now I can
migrate my computer to the new one quite easily (I really love
qmail and I sincerely depend on it to achieve happiness).

My qmail package is not as "clean" as I'd like it be (for instance,
it would be nice if I made its configuration use debconf, but I
think that that is a task for another day).
