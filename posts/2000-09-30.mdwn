Today it is [Alexandre](http://www.ime.usp.br/~lymber/)'s birthday!
Happy birthday, pal! Too bad we're not together today!

Finally went to catch a flick: "What Lies Beneath" (in Portuguese,
"Premonição"). It was supposed to be scary. Ok. Some parts were.
Came back home rightly after the movie was done (which means that
I'd like to get home not so fast next time).
