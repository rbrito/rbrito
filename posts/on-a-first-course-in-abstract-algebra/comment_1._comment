Interesting and informative article. I am a young assistant professor (recently graduated), and going to teach a course in AA soon and was thus searching the internet about any tips/ideas on teaching the subject. I agree with you - abstractness of mathematics and mathematical proofs don't come easily to students. And thus it is a better idea to start with abstract concepts of groups at the very beginning of the semester.
