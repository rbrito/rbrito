Ugh! Just having the thought of having to teach Object-Oriented
Databases gives me headaches---I haven't dealt with Databases for
quite some time and seeing yet another paradigm would just be
insane.

Oh, I finally got the chance to (successfully) use
[FUSE](http://fuse.sf.net) and
[Andrew Morton's Linux Tree](http://www.kernel.org/) so that I
could finally use
[gmailfs](http://richard.jones.name/google-hacks/gmail-filesystem/gmail-filesystem.html)
with my [Debian](http://www.debian.org/)
[testing](http://www.debian.org/releases/testing/) system.

It makes a real mess on your account. So, I would advise you o
create a dummy account if you intend to use it "seriously" (and
don't forget to encrypt what you think is sensitive information).
But it is a damn nice hack.
