Had a quite happy birthday party here with my relatives. We took
some pictures and it was incredible. Got a beautiful red tie, got a
USB 2.0 hub (so that I can use it with the Kurobox, since it only
has a single port and I don't feel like hacking its hardware).

Anyway, back to the topic of my birthday, it was amazing to see my
people together. And the party had a very happy mood. It was
amazing. Thanks to you all, people.
