Went to the Brazilian national Security Service, to see the status
of my sick leave.

After that, I took some time and went to see
[Tiago Vaz](http://tiagovaz.org/), who attended
[this year's](http://debconf9.debconf.org/)
[DebConf](http://www.debconf.org/), which I couldn't attend. I also
met his friendly partner. Well, both are so kind and I felt at home
at his place.

I took some small moments to perform a mini, private key-signing
party, so that we both strengthen our trust networks.

And last, but not least, I got the package that Martin kindly sent
me via Tiago and I'll now start to play with it. I have never
played with an arm-based platform before. Let's see if it is not an
alien to myself.
