Hooray! Another *quite pleasant* news that I had (another)
peer-reviewed work accepted to the
[CNMAC'2006](http://www.congresscentral.com.br/cnmac) Congress.

This time, the work was entitled "Algoritmos de Aproximação para
Alinhamento de Seqüências Biológicas" ("Approximation Algorithms
for Biological Sequence Alignment"). Another nice addition to my
curriculum.
