Typed the remaining bits of the first lecture on the
*Theory of Matroids*.

Read about how one makes a bootable CD for Newworlds with mkisofs:
apparently, the needed things are the following:

* create a folder with `yaboot`, `yaboot.conf`, `vmlinux`, `root.bin`.
  I'm not sure if `boot-floppy-hfs.img` and `ofboot.b` are necessary. I
  also don't have an idea of how OpenFirmware knows that it is
  supposed to load yaboot during the boot;

* `mkisofs -hfs -map <file\> -part -hfs-bless <folder\> -r -o <isoimage.iso\> <root-of-cd\>`

Sent an e-mail to the bastards at
[Linux Journal](http://www.linuxjournal.com/), complaining that I'm
not receiving my issues as I should (and my subscription is far
from being expired).

Discovered that [Apple Brasil](http://www.apple.com.br/) is selling
[iBooks](http://www.apple.com/ibook/) in
[a promotion for education users](http://www.apple.com/br/appleensino/).
Damn!
