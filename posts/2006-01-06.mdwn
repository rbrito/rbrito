There is an amazing discussion about compiler optimizations going
on right now at the lkml. It all began with Ingo Molnar's patches
to improve `.text` size with GCC 4 compilers. Really quite
informative to see both the pros and cons of using the `inline`
keyword of the C compilers.

Oh, by the way, while the discussion reached the consensus that
using `inline` in abundance is a problem, it reminded me that
people should use `static` for functions that are meant to be used
only in the compilation unit where they appear. This way, GCC is
even able reduce the size of the generated binaries (not exactly
sure if this would impact the running size of the binaries---I
still have to investigate that).

I was so tired today that I slept for about 16h. I needed that.
