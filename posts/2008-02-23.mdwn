Had the pleasant company of a friend when going to the theater so
that we could watch
["The Bucket List"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0825232/) ("Antes
de Partir"), with Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. While waiting
for the flick session to start, we went to Saraiva Megastore, and
browsing through their DVD shows, I found
[Dream Theater](http://www.dreamtheater.net/)'s
["Live at Budokan"](http://www.dreamtheater.net/disco_videography.php?s=budokan2dvd)
for a feasible price.

It was a very pleasant evening and the company was especially
good.
