It's quite hard to study when one has an amazing number of new
[Opeth](http://www.opeth.com/) bootlegs, including **14** audio
bootlegs and **5** video bootlegs. I am simply shocked!

As if those things were not enough (and to make matters worse),
**2** new bootlegs in the
[Dream Theater](http://www.dreamtheater.net) front appeared:

* one from Paris, 3 hours long, from the new tour;
* the other, from Barcelona, where they played *the entire*
  "Master of Puppets" album, from the band formerly called Metallica

Wow! I don't have this much bandwidth, damnit!!! I also need to
study to present a
[seminar](http://www.ime.usp.br/~rbrito/listas/bio/).

It seems that [Dan Bernstein](http://cr.yp.to/djb.html) is
[changing](http://cr.yp.to/) his computers from
[OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/) to
[FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/). I wonder what the cause could
be...
