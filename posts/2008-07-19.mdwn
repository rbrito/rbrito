Have been
[working quite a bit](http://lame.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/lame/lame/doc/html/history.html?revision=HEAD)
on the [LAME](http://lame.sf.net/) project to have the best MP3
encoder around. It's been all a learning exercise dealing with all
the magic behind
[autotools](http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/autotools.html).

Fortunately, there are some areas where we can fix with just a
working knowledge of C and computer architecture, like fixing the
interface to the
[Open Sound System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_System)
[`abx` tool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABX_test) that comes with
lame (in the `misc` directory), as well as the
[endianness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) problems.
