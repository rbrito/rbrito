I went to the physician today again to see how far I progressed. It
seems that I am going well all, within the expected, and that I
will be back in shape in two months. Nice to know that.

Also had the opportunity to listen to the newest
[Opeth](http://www.opeth.com/) album, *Ghost Reveries* quite a bit
earlier than its official release date (30th of August), according
to
[Blabbermouth](http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=39014).
Sweet!
