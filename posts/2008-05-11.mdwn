Spent some time working on what to talk on the seminar in Error
Correcting Codes. Since the audience isn't that experienced with
programming, I will have a lot of background to cover like what a
simplified computer architecture is, what are the usual program
constructs in a high-level language, how the complexity of an
algorithm is evaluated, asymptotic notation, examples of some
algorithms relevant to this audience, like the
[greatest common divisor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)
by Euclid's
[Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) and
Lam√©'s theorem. Of course, it is particularly important to cover
the methods of multiplication of matrices like Strassen's
Algorithm.
