Today it was a "software writing" day. I woke up early in the
morning and then I decided to fix
[vrms](http://bugs.debian.org/src:vrms). I have almost taken the
role of a maintainer, with the exception that I am not one. I have
changed the severity of bugs, merged them etc. All without the
maintainers saying **anything**. Impressive.

I, then, updated the package and put a new version of it at
[my homepage](http://www.ime.usp.br/~rbrito/debian/) for perusal by
other developers.

In other news, I have updated the page for the
[algorithms](http://algorithms.berlios.de) package, now with a
[screenshot](http://algorithms.berlios.de/screenshots.html). I have
also done some janitorial work on the
[feature requests](http://developer.berlios.de/feature/?group_id=3442).

It seems that
[sarge won't be released on the 30th of May](http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/05/msg00020.html),
unfortunately.
