This moment of the year is just hectic. Having to prepare the
finals is a bad moment, but scoring them is really terrible.

Oh, and just as a reminder to myself, to use the subversion tree on
[BerliOS](http://developer.berlios.de/) for
[my project/algorithms](http://algorithms.berlios.de), I have to
use:
export SVN\_SSH="ssh -l myusername"
svn co svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/algorithms/ I keep
forgetting that.

Oh, and I am almost complete with the syllabus of the Linux course.
There is so much that I want to cover that the course will have to
be broken in modules. Four or five modules, that is.
