Made some commits to the CVS version of
[lame](http://sf.net/projects/lame), since version 3.97 is expected
to have its status upgraded from alpha to beta.

Took care of spell-fixing some bits of documentation, but didn't
have the time to do a proper job. Some work will be postponed until
the 3.98 release opens for development.

Oh, and it seems that [algorithms](http://algorithms.berlios.de/)
has reached a good "mind share" in the sense that some leading
Computer Scientists seem to use it.
