Had a nice Friday after I woke up. The plan of going to
"Villa-Lobos Shopping Center" just to see a movie ended up being
better by *not* seeing the movie. It was just as pleasant as it
could get.

Going back home wasn't that easy, though, but I eventually arrived
at my place without further problems.
