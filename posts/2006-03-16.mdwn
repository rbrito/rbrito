Today, I resurrected Loreena McKennitt's
["The Mask and Mirror"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mask_and_Mirror)
and it now plays without skipping in any place. It's so nice to
have it "back"...

I'm slowly progressing towards a better condition of my throat.
This is taking longer than what I expected.

Finally took some time to go to the police station to register the
damage done to my car.

Oh, and I got some new toys to play with, including a brand new
Firewire enclosure, wireless stuff and some DVD-R's. Fun ahead.
