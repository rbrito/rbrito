Spent some time checking out the repository of
[the algorithms bundle](http://algorithms.berlios.de), since I plan
on doing a new release, now in the format of `.dtx` and `.ins`
files. This will be much more convenient to handle and I already
put the licences onto the files, which is
[LGPL 2.1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License),
for the moment (which can change in the future).
