My mind is getting (even) fuzzier: haven't got enough sleep all
these days (an average of 5 or 4 hours) and this is really not
sufficient for me. This can be attributed to the huge number of
classes I'm now taking (6). Some of them are interesting, some are
not. And some were able to scare the shit out of me. I could be
taking yet another class if I were able to wake up on time today.
But I wasn't. I'll dump some of them anyway, but this week is quite
hectic. The problem is: there are still two days left for the
weekend, let alone the fact that I'll probably have to work this
Sunday. Oh, well...
