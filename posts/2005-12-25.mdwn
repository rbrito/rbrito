Still encoding the videos. Some surprise here, because it seems
that [toolame](http://packages.debian.org/toolame) has some bug
when encoding audio in some cases. Had to fix some of the MPEGs.

And while I did that, I took some moments to fix some of the audio
deficiencies with [audacity](http://packages.debian.org/audacity).
Too bad that Audacity doesn't have a Treeble booster filter built
right into it, but only a generic (and harder to use) Equalization
filter.

Oh, and it seems that Christian Marillat has packaged version 1.8.0
of [mjpegtools](http://mjpeg.sf.net/), while I'm still using
version 1.6.2. I don't want to switch right now, for consistency
purposes with the videos that I already have encoded.

Oh, yes, still encoding videos. It is quite slow.
