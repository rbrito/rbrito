Feelling extremely bad today. I have an enormous headache. I think
that I will work a little bit on
[algorithms](http://algorithms.berlios.de/), but I don't know if I
will be able to commit anything today. I can't really concentrate
and I don't want to release something that I am not proud of.

I have, BTW, been swamped by e-mail. Please, stop the madness! I
can understand why Donald Knuth quit this 15 years ago. I
understand that he must be a happier man without Internet annoying
him (especially since he is such a precious celebrity).

The funnier thing is that people rarely realize how they are doing
things backwards today: they are working more for the computer than
the computer is working for them. They don't care about things
being automated, which is one thing where computers shine at.

In fact, I think that such things are the way they are due to the
ignorance of the potential of a computer. Indeed, there are tasks
that a computer can't embrace (the halting problem, the tiling
problem etc already told us this), but for other mundane things,
computers are useful. Just not the way people seem to be using
them.

And this, BTW, includes people with high education (like many
Ph.D.'s that I know): they simply don't make their life easier. One
example of this in action: using
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) is a way of producing
high-quality documents. But some people that are actually convinced
that LaTeX is the way to go rarely take the time to use this tool
in all its usefulness. What a pity!

Whenever I see people doing wrong things, I tell them a better way.
[Very few](http://www.ime.usp.br/~lymber/) seem to understand that,
but others don't.

In other news, Linus released a new
[kernel](http://www.kernel.org), 2.6.12.
