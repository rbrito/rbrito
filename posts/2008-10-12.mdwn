Had
[two patches of mine](http://www.ohloh.net/p/linux/contributors/13492639846816)
included in the Linux kernel. My first two contributions to the
kernel, which is a nice thing. Both related to the kurobox, so that
it can have a better default for compilation. And I think that I
will take care of the PowerPC side of things, so that I can have
some boxen that work right and with new software.

These contributions (and the Debian Maintainership status) has to
be recorded on my Curriculum Vitae, kept at the Ministry of Science
of Brazil (where all higher education professionals have to keep
their information).
