[[!meta  title="Happy News: A new Kurobox"]]

Today I was pleasantly surprised that the Kurobox that <a href="http://suihkulokki.blogspot.com/">Riku Voipio</a> sent me has arrived! From the looks of it, it is a Kurobox HG, which, compared to my Kurobox HD, has a faster processor (it runs at 266MHz, instead of 200MHz), has more RAM (128MB, instead of 64MB), and has a faster network connection (an 1Gbps instead of 100Mbps interface).

I'm trying to see if I will be able to use a SATA drive with this Kurobox, as we can't find large IDE/PATA drives in the market today (almost). And the bigger capacity ones are only available with SATA interfaces.
