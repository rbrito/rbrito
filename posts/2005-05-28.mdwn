I have now, with the help of an oooold
[ATI Mach 64 GX](http://www.atitech.ca/) card (with only 2MB of
VRAM) gotten [MacOS X 10.3.9](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) to work
on the
[PowerMac](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/powermac/stats/powermac_9500_180mp.html).
I then substituted the card with an IMS Twin Turbo card that has
4MB of VRAM. It seems to work well, considering that this machine
has almost 10 years (a PeeCee normally doesn't last this much). If
I were to upgrade this machine, I would start by the following two
items (perhaps not in this order):

1.  Substitude its HD.
2.  Add more RAM to it. MacOS X likes a lot of RAM.

Perhaps I may get a [Sonnet Tech](http://www.sonnettech.com/)
[Tempo Trio](http://www.sonnettech.com/product/tempo_trio.html)
card, which features an IDE controller, a Firewire controller and a
USB 2.0 controller in just one card. Seems like a good deal,
especially for using (faster, modern) IDE HDs, all this being able
to just use a single slot of the machine.
