Got sick and went to the hospital. Unfortunately, I could't go to
work. This has possibly messed with my schedule, but what exactly
could I do? I'm voiceless and the medications that I took gave me
allergic reactions. These times have been a bit unfortunate.

Still have to go to [IME](http://www.ime.usp.br/) to study Abstract
Algebra (in an undergraduate level, but who cares?), get the last
parcel of my payment and the finals of
[the Summer Course](http://www.ime.usp.br/~rbrito/verao/2006)
(which I have to grade soon).
