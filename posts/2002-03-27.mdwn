Have you ever felt *cheated* just by watching a movie? I would
never think it would be possible, but, in fact, it is. Especially
depending on the circumstances. Let me say that again in a
different manner. *Especially* depending on who you talk to during
and after the movies.

drained. I don't even have the energy to say more about this, even
though I want to...

Attended the seminar on Molecular
Computational Biology. Worked a bit more on my Master's Thesis.
