Spent some time polishing my [Debian](http://www.debian.org/)
package for [qmail](http://cr.yp.to/), with the patches managed by
quilt. Now, everything is more maintainable, despite the fact that
separating one monolithic patch into smaller patches was a pain.

I finally got some time to experience
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.org/)'s latest distribution on my iBook.
Unfortunately, there seems to be serious problems with the live CD
as X isn't working correctly. `:-(`. I still don't know what could
be the cause, since the framebuffer was set at 1024x768, but X
insisted on the resolution being 800x600.
