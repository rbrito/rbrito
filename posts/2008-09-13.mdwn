Updated my [qmail](http://www.qmail.org/)
[Debian](http://www.debian.org/) package to support the new source
format of source packages, "3.0 (quilt)". It was a breeze to move
to this new format and the support is already available in
`dpkg-source` available on
[unstable](http://www.debian.org/unstable/). This was a very good
learning exercise of the things to come, especially for
ill-packaged programs from upstream, like
[hfsprogs](http://packages.debian.org/hfsprogs), which I maintain.

I also checked the new things that my package needed to do to be
compliant with the new
[Debian Policy](http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/) (3.8.0).
It is now in a very good shape, I'd say (except for the fact that I
still think that I should use `debconf` for asking questions to the
user, so that everything is cleaner).

Also read quite a good amount of nice things on
[`debian-mentors`](http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors),
especially a discussion regarding PHP programs, and a discussion on
adopting packages. I think that I may even adopt some
[dock applications](http://dockapps.org/) for use with
[fluxbox](http://www.fluxbox.org/).

Continued with my (slow) reading of
["Advanced Unix Programming"](http://www.basepath.com/aup), even
though the author likes to bash [Linux](http://www.kernel.org/) and
[FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/) a lot and seems to like Darwin
and Solaris. Anyway, read a bit on basic I/O manipulation via the
file system calls like `open`, `read`, `write`, `close`.
Interesting to see them being used to implement a mutex.
