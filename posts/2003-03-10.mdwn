Finally got myself [Opeth's](http://www.opeth.com/) brand new
(actually, not even released) album, Damnation.

Cooked my first bread! Amazingly fun! I even took a picture to
document this special day.

Updated my father's computer, installed the tax program and
installed [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/) for him.

Wrote another bit about HMMs for my Master's work.
