After a lot of time doing this Combinatorial Optimization homework,
I found out that a lot of my colleagues didn't even bother to prove
that their algorithms worked, while I've spent a lot of time
finding algorithm invariants and proving that they were actually
maintained from interation to iteration. This is the Right
Thing(tm) to do, but it also takes a lot of time. What should I do
next time?
