I've been (re-)discovering multimedia and all its wonders. It all
started with me seeing how [Apple](http://www.apple.com/)'s
[Front Row](http://www.apple.com/macmini/frontrow.html) application
works. Ok, so I am behind the times. I'm fine with that, but
catching up. The world is changing sooooo fast that it is hard to
keep up. Podcasts, wireless networks, media centers, digital video,
digital (still) cameras, megapixels and the like.

Add to that the things that "need to be known" by a Computer
Scientist/Mathematician-wannabe and we quickly arrive at the
conclusion that the days are way too short with their current 24
hours.

It, unfortunately, sucks and the fact that Apple is now "changing
gears" to support their [Intel](http://www.intel.com/)
[Core](http://www.apple.com/macmini/intelcore.html) processors is a
clear signal that their PowerPC line is dead and only waiting for
its coffin to be burried.

What the solution to this problem is? Partially, to employ Open
Source technology to leverage this to current standards, using
hardware that is already employed. We can *hardly*, expect the new
machines to outnumber the installed resources that we already have.
And have to keep working.
