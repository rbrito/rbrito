Today, most of [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) 2.12 has entered
testing, which is good. Also
[OpenOffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org/) 2.0.1 also entered.
Let's see if it plays some presentations that I have here that were
*slow* when played with OO.o 2.0.0.

Ugh! Paying through the roof for the mistakes made the other day.
An arm and a leg. :-(

Hooray! Finally the Nightwish torrent from their 2003-06-20 show is
complete. It was a digital broadcast show and the quality is
amazing. I only had this one on a DivX file, but now that I have
the real thing, I will burn this one. The only "problem" is that it
only uses half of a DVD. Is there any way of putting another show
in a DVD, without having to author it and destroy its current
structure? That would definitely be nice.
