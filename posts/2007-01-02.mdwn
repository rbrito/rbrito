Started thinking about the new offering of the Summer Course. I
hope to cover some aspects of graph theory now. I just noticed that
the length of the course now seems to be 12h bigger. With a little
bit of exams and homework, I think that I can manage to cover more
aspects of the development of correct algorithms (thank you very
much Prof. Dijkstra!).
