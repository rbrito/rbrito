Had some programming session on working with
[hfsprogs](http://packages.debian.org/hfsprogs)'s packaging for
Debian. I finally saw how to build a multi-arch building and
introduced some cruft to compile it under amd64 (aka,
[x86-64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64)), since
[Apple](http://www.apple.com/)'s code is
[not 64-bit clean](http://bugs.debian.org/436159). Ugh!

And that's because they have the guts to show us their source code.
Imagine what a disaster it is to see proprietary software that is
completely closed!
