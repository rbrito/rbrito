After waking up at 2pm, I found myself pondering if I should or not
go to McDonald's to get those 10 Big Macs that mom had bought for
Mc Dia Feliz. I went and then, after being stuffed, went again to
my uncle's shop. I brought him my comp and he made a cool hack to
change my computer's battery. My computer seems happier and
healthier. Ok, not sure about happier, but it sure looks healthier.
And just found out that my uncle had a cool, brand-new
[ADSL](http://www.speedy.com.br) installed in his office. Wow!
Those things kick some major ass! Downloading MP3s faster than I
can play them. It's officially a Good Thing(tm).
