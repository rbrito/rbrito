[[!meta title="Packaging fonts for a Debian-based system"]]
[[!meta date="Fri, 12 Nov 2010 11:23:55 -0200"]]

Seeing now that the situation regarding Free fonts is much better than in
the past, I have started packaging some that are of high enough quality so
that we can have it available on our systems (be it Debian or any of the
good derivatives).

In particular, I spent some time during the past few days [packaging][*]
some that, I think, deserve to be mentioned:

* [ParaType Sans][0]: this typeface family consists of a set of proportional,
  sans-serif fonts that supply a lot of Cyrillic glyphs.
  
  **Purpose**: the intention of this font is that of supporting many of the
  smaller ethnic and cultural aspects present in Russia. It was even funded
  by the Russian Government: in particular, by the
  [Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation][1].
  
  **Why you should care**: for those (like me) that use a Latin-based
  alphabet, the fonts also have some nice attractives, like, besides the
  usual 4 shape/weight combinations (regular, italic, bold, bold italic),
  two other variants: PT Sans Narrow (with its respective bold) and PT Sans
  Caption (also with bold).
  
  On top of that, the fonts support ligatures (liga, dlig), fractions
  (frac), ordinals (ordn), and glyph composition (ccmp), among *other*
  OpenType features.

* [Anonymous Pro][2]: this typeface family consists of a set of fixed-width
  fonts with the usual 4 shape/weight combinations (regular, italic, bold,
  bold italic).
  
  **Purpose**: Anonymous Pro was made with people that stare at a computer
  screen, coding for long amounts of time, or people that use a terminal all
  the time.  Apart from being scalable, it also features some pre-made
  bitmap versions at some sizes (10, 11, 12, and 13), so that they should
  look better than some automatically drawn font without proper
  [TrueType hinting][3].
  
  My package still is not good enough, as I have not yet included explicit
  support for the bitmapped sizes via some fontconfig configuration, but I
  expect to fix those in two or three days.
  
  (This should just be a matter of including something like

        <edit name="embeddedbitmap" mode="assign">
            <bool>true</bool>
        </edit>

  in the configuration that I ship with the fonts).
  
* [Cardo][4]: this is produced by David Perry and it is a proportional,
  serif, old-style typeface similar to some highly regarded fonts like
  Bembo. It does not offer italic, or bold versions.
  
  **Purpose**: Cardo's target "audience" are scholars that need to type set
  Medieval texts, it has *many* glyphs, support for many opentype features
  and the author has told me that he may even provide some support for
  typesetting Mathematics (and this *is* a very big deal, since typesetting
  Mathematics is hard enough when you decide to change your typefaces).
  
  It works quite well with Jonathan Kew's [XeTeX][5] and you should just try
  it, especially if you are into serif fonts (like I am).

* [Droid][6]: this consists of three font families, with varying shapes and
  weights, in sans-serif, sans-serif monospaced, and serif families.  It has
  received a lot of press, due to it being sponsored by Google and made by
  Ascender Corporation.

  **Purpose**: the Droid fonts were made for Google's Android platform and
  one of the main concerns was to be readable on devices with low resolution
  (like computer screens). It has a very wide coverage of glyphs (as one
  would expect from a font for phones) and have very high quality. A really
  nice donation to the world.

* [Linux Libertine][7]: this has to be one of the most beautiful fonts that
  I have see in a while. It has the basic four combinations of a serif font
  
  **Purpose**: to provide a beautiful, "organic" version of a typeface that
  can substitute Times/Times New Roman. It works well both with "regular"
  latex/pdflatex and with XeTeX (and, quite probably, with LuaTeX). It has
  quite a lot of OpenType features:
  
        rbrito:~$ otfinfo -f /usr/share/fonts/truetype/linux-libertine/LinLibertine_Re.ttf | wc -l
        25
        rbrito:~$
  
  OK, I can't be impartial with this font. It is beautiful. It is a pity
  that we are in a feature freeze and that a the new version
  [won't probably be included in squeeze][8].

* [Heuristica ("Эвристика")][9]: since Adobe has [donated][10] [Utopia][11]
  to the [TeX Users's Group][12] under a Free Software license, it was only
  a matter of time that people would tweak them and generate other versions.
  Then comes Andrey Panov's Heuristica, a modified version of the four basic
  typefaces that Adobe donated, in OpenType format (and, to boot, some
  [nice scripts for fontforge][13]).
  
  **Purpose**: Heuristica improves Utopia with the primary intent of adding
  Cyrillic symbols by Andrey V. Panov. Andrey has also incorporated
  Vietnamese glyphs made available by Hàn Thế Thành. Heuristica is a family
  that features regular and italic shapes, with both being present also in
  bold weight.
 

Well, that's it for now. Stay tuned for more to come.
