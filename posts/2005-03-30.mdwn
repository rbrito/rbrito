Woohoo! Finally I received a nice little package with two G3
upgrade cards (and one IMSTT card). This is great news for me to
upgrade the PowerMac 9500/180MP that I have here.

Curiously, only one of its memory sticks (it has 2 32MB sticks) was
being recognized by the system. I had to open it and it took me
quite some time to figure out why (after some tweaking) the system
wouldn't boot anymore. I have no idea why, but just zapping the
NVRAM worked (i.e., Cmd+Option+P+R).

The next step now is to see if I can get more memory for this
system, so that I can actually use it after this welcome upgrade.
Then, I will surely be playing with
[Debian](http://www.debian.org/)'s
[sarge](http://www.debian.org/releases/sarge).
