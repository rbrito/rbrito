Another usual day, without much to say. I've been struggling to use
my University's network, but the system administrators take so
little care of it... What a pity. :-( My home system is in better
shape, actually (ok, but them I'm a nerd that almost lives for his
computer and that may be an excuse, but I thought that it was a
prerequisite for all system administrators to be one).

The catch is that I have to use that network to access some
academic databases and doing it at sane hours is painfully sloooow.
Pehaps other people are giving it more important uses, like
Napster.
