I haven't been having as much time to update my diary as I'd expect
to have, but I'm updating it in bursts as I can. Anyway, I strongly
suspect the world is keeping a secret conspiration against me. This
past week could surely be better. And to make matters worse, this
past night, just when I was going to sleep my brand new glasses got
broken. I'm now using some old glasses and I can't see very well.
The interesting thing: I didn't even pay all parcels of my new
glasses. I just wish I didn't have this huge shortsightedness.
