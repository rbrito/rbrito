Had a most pleasant night with one of my dearest friends. Every
single second was worth it and it is too bad that I couldn't go to
the meeting earlier. Getting to the destination was much easier
than I thought and, luckily, the traffic didn't interfere (which,
BTW, is getting out of hand).

Anyway, I wished that those moments were repeatable *ad eternum*.
Yes, it was that good.
