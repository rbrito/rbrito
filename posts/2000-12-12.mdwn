Went to a customer to upgrade his system, which was using a frozen
potato. I must confess that I love Debian indeed. The upgrades are
painless, fast, clean.

I also upgraded the kernel of the server from 2.2.16 to 2.2.18, now
that the stable Linux version was just released. And it performs so
well, serving files to a whole slew of MICROS\~1 machines, despite
the fact that it only has 32MB of memory. And even more remarkable
is the fact that it is a server running with lots of things
on-board. A quite modest machine. Getting its job done. Reliably.
