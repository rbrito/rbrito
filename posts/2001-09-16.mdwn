Got up late (3pm) and went to the shopping mall intending to see
Kubrick's "AI", but got there after the session had already
started. Since we had to leave soon, we opted to see "O Dom da
Premonição" ("The Gift") which was one of the few movies that I
have seen lately that was actually a bit scary. And it was quite
worth the price of admission.
