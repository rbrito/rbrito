Well, some progress on the PPC front. I've just configured the PMac
to use the `imstt` driver instead of the `fbdev`. Due to this, the
X server is now *much* faster. In fact, the whole computer is much
faster. Before, it spent a lot of processing power just to update
the screen. Since it is not exactly the most powerful computer in
the world, those few moments indeed were important.

It is very fast and now it is almost able to play AVI files with
MPlayer. Almost.

This Mac is now very usable and I'd even dare to say that it would
be a good workstation, were it not that outdated (well, if one
could find replacement hardware for it easily...)

I think that'll end summarizing all the "Mac Journey" in a homepage
to save future souls enduring the problems that I've experienced
(kernel configuration file, XF86Config file etc). It seems that
Linux running on PPC is indeed a quite nice alternative to paying
huge prices just for being able to run MacOS 9.

Also installed the superb
[Liquid Theme](http://www.mosfet.org/liquid.html) for KDE2. It's
amazingly beautiful and quite fast, despite all the eye-candy. It
makes your Linux desktop seem like you are running
[Apple](http://www.apple.com/)'s
[MacOS X's Acqua](http://www.apple.com/macosx/).

On the down side of things, I guess that I'm just encountering many
aspects of Perl that I don't like. It's saddening that I've spent
so much time and money (buying books) for something that I'm not
really enjoying (but it's ok).
