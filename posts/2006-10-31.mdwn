Today, I was a bit more productive than other days: the class on
Graph Theory covered Matchings and I could prove half of Berge's
theorem on Maximum Matchings. One might ask: "gee, only half the
theorem" and yes, it was only the "easy" part of the theorem, but I
made clear that all steps were understood (or, at least, accepted)
by my students. They aren't trained with formal proofs,
unfortunately.

I also got in touch with developers of the
[Debian TeX](http://lists.debian.org/debian-tex-maint/), which has
the presence of some upstream developers of
[TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/). The main thing to get in
contact with them is that I started teaching some students of mine
how to deal with [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/), the
wonderful infra-structure proviced by [CTAN](http://www.ctan.org/),
the
[TeX Catalogue OnLine](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/)
and how [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) works in general.
