Got myself a leaner
[operating system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20system)
without a heavy graphics interface: just fluxbox. This means that I
am able now to see how slow Iceweasel is, especially when switching
virtual desktops. `:-(`

I also was happy to see that
[hfsprogs](http://packages.debian.org/hfsprogs) version 334.14-3
migrated to testing (and I wasn't expecting that---I completely
forgot about this since I'm using unstable exclusively).

Prepared a new version of `hfsprogs` with more support for 32-bit
architectures supported by [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) and
with initial support for `amd64`. Rhonda has been helping me a lot
understanding the infra-structure behind Debian.

Oh, discovered what it takes to make an Apple "Universal" binary:
just compile `program.c` with the options
`-arch i386 -arch ppc -arch ppc64` like:

    gcc -arch i386 -arch ppc -arch ppc64 program.c -o program
