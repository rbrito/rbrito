Well, I didn't go to my customer today, as I expected. I received a
call telling me that they wouldn't be able to receive me.

Anyway, I think that today was a modestly productive day: I spent a
lot of time sending e-mails dealing with bureaucratic matters (like
the English proficiency exam, my quest in trying to get a financial
support for my studies and a status update to advisor).

I'm really, really crossing my fingers to go to IBM's
[Summer Jobs](http://www.research.ibm.com/summerjobs/), but,
sincerely, I don't know what they are looking for in people
applying for the positions. I guess that I should study more right
now.
