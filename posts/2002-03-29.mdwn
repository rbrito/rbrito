Today, I could sleep better, at least.

Also read a tiny little bit about
[DocBook](http://www.docbook.org/). Some things still aren't clear
on my mind regarding SGML and DocBook, though.

It was nice to have [avifile](http://avifile.sf.net/) enter woody,
which means that now I can use it on PPC.

The bad news of the day is that
[Iname/Mail.com](http://www.iname.com/) will not be forwarding
mails, starting early next month. [Yahoo!](http://mail.yahoo.com/)
is joining them, which means that I'll have to seriously consider
using my [Mac.com](http://www.mac.com) addresses for POP3/IMAP.

[Which](http://www.python.org/) [programming](http://www.perl.com/)
[language](http://java.sun.com/)
[should](http://www.objective-c.org/) I learn? To be sincere, I
don't know. I'm under the impression that the combo
[Python](http://www.python.org/)/[Jython](http://www.jython.org/)
is what offers me the greatest effort/satisfaction ratio, for many
different values of satisfaction.
