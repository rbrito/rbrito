The day of my first talk. Despite the fact that I have rushed the
presentation (otherwise I couldn't talk 1/10th of what I had to
say), I think that things went quite OK here.

Oh, this time, the iBook saved my day, for burning a CD with the
presentation in PDF format (a requirement of the organization) with
only 10 minutes to start the talk.
