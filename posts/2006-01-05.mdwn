Some amazing new packages are coming into Debian's testing
distribution. What a great time to live using Free Software only.

Somehow, I "bribed" Alexandre to get him to see one of my classes,
where covered recursion and the Towers of Hanoi Problem. :-) He
told me that the class was "unusual". I have yet to ask him what
exactly about it was unusual, but it seems that he thought that it
wasn't bad. :-)
