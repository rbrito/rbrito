I have discovered that while Linus' 2.6.12 kernel seems OK with my
IDE HD in the Firewire enclosure, both of Andrew Morton's `-mm1` and
`-mm2` trees are broken regarding the device. I posted to the lkml
and got some nice responses. That's one of the reasons why Open
Source Software is good: you can actually get in touch with people
responsible for fixing things without "the middle man".

Have been chaotically reading about [Java](http://java.sun.com/),
since I am excited by all the progress that the
[Free](http://www.kaffe.org/) [Software](http://www.sablevm.org/)
[Implementations](http://gcc.gnu.org/java/)
[of](http://jikes.sf.net/) Java have shown recently. It seems that
the major milestone now is to improve the
[GNU](http://www.gnu.org/)
[Classpath](http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/) project. Every
other JVM would benefit from a bigger implementation of the Java
API from GNU Classpath, if I understand things correctly.

When I said that I was chaotically reading about Java, I meant the
first edition of James Gosling's book (that's the only one that I
have here). Unfortunately, the translation that I have is *so* full
of **atrocious** errors that it is a disservice to an otherwise
fine book (even if somewhat outdated).

Oh, and by chaotically reading things, I also meant reading about
how [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) 1.1 works, so that
I can better manage [algorithms](http://algorithms.berlios.de/).
