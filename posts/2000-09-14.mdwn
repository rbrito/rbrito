Tired. Tired. Tired.

It seems that my Mastership will have something to do with
phylogenetic trees. But that is only a wild guess. I'll have first
to understand the seemingly (for a Mathematician, at least)
confusing problems.

Still haven't received an answer for my e-mail to Ajato. So much
for a timely answer.

[Nectar](../nectar/index.html) is temporarily disabled. I'm still
thinking where to host it (e-groups?).

Still listening to "Classical" Music today: Symphony X and Yngwie
Malmsteen's Concerto.

For some reason, it seems that today I can order from The End
Records. Weird.
