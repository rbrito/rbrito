It seems that dad is with a quite fragile health. I hope very
dearly that he has a better luck than my grandfather and doesn't
need a surgery (since we would all be scared of that, anyway).

Got the material for the first series of
[Deutsche Welle's](http://www.dw-world.de/)
["Deutsch: Warum Nicht?"](http://www.dw-world.de/dw/0,2142,2595,00.html)
course (which I had already printed) bound. It will be much better
to follow the stories and exercises this way.
