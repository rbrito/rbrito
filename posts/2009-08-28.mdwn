I'm closing some bugs in many packages in Debian, including my
preferred backup system,
[Mondo Rescue](http://www.mondorescue.org/). The good thing about
it is that it generates a backup that is a "mirror" (or should I
say "snapshot"?) of your system and puts it on a CD (or DVD, or ISO
image, or many other formats, actually).

I make backups almost every single day and I try to keep them
small. Very small. The purpose is to have everything fit on a
single 650MB CD, the reason being twofold:

* There are more computers with a CD drive than with a DVD drive
  (or a Bluray drive, for that matter). To be honest, I have never
  ever seen a bluray drive.
* It is easier to find 650MB CDs than 700MBs (well, that's
  changing fast). Also, making it smaller than a certain amount
  leaves room for Error Correcting Codes, like those created by the
  superb [dvdisaster](http://dvdisaster.net/en/). With some
  overburning, I can even squeeze one or two megabytes more in the
  CD.
