Went to my University to go to the library and there was a seminar
there. I stayed after being kindly asked by the professor that
coordinates the seminar. `:-)`

After that, I decided that it would be nice to go to the library to
visit once more the section of Number Theory. I was aware that
Diophantine equations were important. But I just didn't know that
elliptic curves are Diophantine equations. And the subject is
dense.

By the way, talking about Number Theory, I'm starting to feel the
need of studying some Mathematical Analysis: the whole area of
Analytic Number Theory is alien to me and it shouldn't be (for a
person that aims at knowing the basics of Number Theory). Actually,
I can't even recall some basic facts from my calculus courses. I
think that it is high time for a refresher.
