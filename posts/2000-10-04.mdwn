Oh, I'm finally surfing the web at mach speed. Great. Ok, not so
great. My fuckning provider (which is not the same as the telco
co.) has my DNS entries messed up and I need to log in my
University's computer running SSH to stablish my SSH tunnel for
gathering my mail via POP.

The catch: my University's computer runs in PARANOID mode and I
don't even get prompted for my pass{phrase,word}.
