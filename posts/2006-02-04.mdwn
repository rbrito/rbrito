The world is full of people, of course. But only a handful of those
matter for us. And today I had the please of meeting one of those
special people, that makes the world go in an unexpected way, that
makes our head spin so madly without us knowing exactly why.

So much time has passed since I last felt this way and, to be
honest, I think that I could live my whole life this way.
