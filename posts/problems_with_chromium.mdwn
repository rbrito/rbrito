[[!meta title="My problems with Chromium"]]

Given that Chromium/Chrome is used more and more (as became apparent
[with the discussion of including it in Debian's squeeze][0]), I decided to
give it some tries, mainly Giuseppe Iuculano's [version][1]. I occasionally
install Chromium from Fabien Tassin's [daily builds][2].

And, to be honest, I have also contributed a good amount (about 400) of
[translated strings][3] to the Brazilian Portuguese part of Chromium. As a
matter of fact, I have even done some "activism" and [incentivated][4]
[other][5] [people][6] to create their accounts on Launchpad and help with
the projects.

But I always come back to Iceweasel/Firefox, especially with Mike Hommey's
frequently updated [repository][7].

What are my reasons for staying with Iceweasel, and not with Chromium?

* I can disable full zoom in Iceweasel (i.e., I only want to zoom the text,
  not the images). According to Chromium's project BTS, it seems that this
  will be a `WONTFIX` bug, despite many people asking for it (and it having
  a lot of duplicates).
* I can, in Iceweasel, set my preferred fonts without resorting to hacks on
  the system level, like say, having to lie with fontconfig or other stuff.
  And I really want Deja Vu Sans, not a serifed font.
* In Iceweasel, a middle mouse click on "an inactive portion" of the page
  makes me go to the URL that is the system clipboard, just like pasting
  stuff in X, in general, works.  I guess that there may be some way to
  enable this in Chromium, but, so far, I have not found it.
* In Iceweasel, I have a way (without resorting to many extensions or
  hackish solutions) to use the equivalent of Firefox's "View > Page Style >
  No Style" (i.e., to ignore any CSS sheet that the document author may have
  specified on the page).
* In Iceweasel, my personal data is encrypted before being synced.
* In Iceweasel, I can press `Ctrl+Q` and make the damn browser quit, instead
  of me having to use the mouse/trackpad/pointing device. This is probably a
  lack of my understanding on how to associate key bindings to Chromium, but
  the problem still stands.
* Similarly, when there is only one tab open, pressing `Ctrl+W` in Chromium
  does not close the tab (say, presenting me a blank tab or the list of most
  visited sites), nor it closes the application.

I would be satisfied if any of the above were fixed or better documented,
but it seems that some of those are, at best, going to wait a long time.
