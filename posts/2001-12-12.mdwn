Lots of things going on. I'm now even more sure that I do want one
of those [new and sweet iBooks](http://www.apple.com/ibook/). They
are so sweet, come with a long-lasting battery, have a 1024x768 res
LCD, a Firewire port, a 10/100 Ethernet port, a reasonably big HD
and an ATI card. In my opinion, it's only drawback: it doesn't have
a PCMCIA slot.

As an added bonus, what could be cooler than Apple now selling its
[new Operating System](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) as the
"World's Most Advanced Operating System", when, in fact, it is a
[Unix](http://www.apple.com/darwin/) under the hood?

And it **[runs Linux](http://www.tuxppc.org/)**! Not only that, but
if I ever get tired of Linux and want MacOS X, I can have
[it with the power of Debian](http://fink.sf.net).

But well, there *is* another drawback. Nothing can be perfect. Of
course. These things are so damn expensive here in my country,
mostly due to the absurd exchange rates and to the
[huge taxes](http://www.receita.fazenda.gov.br). Anything that
isn't obtained with the welcome, kind help of the "gray markets" is
so damn expensive (to the point of quickly becoming intangible).
Which means that I'll probably not have one iBook unless I go
travel and come back with one.

Learned a bit more about Perl. Became a bit scared with the amound
of things it does at run-time. Isn't there a switch for the
compiler/optimizer to tell it: "perform only what I tell you and
optimize the hell out of this code"?
