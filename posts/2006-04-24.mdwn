While searching for old messages indicating that I was running
[Debian](http://www.debian.org/), I unfortunately could not find
anything older than
[this message](http://groups.google.com/group/linux.debian.user/msg/d560a1f22b139358?hl=en),
but I am quite, quite sure that I had been using Debian for much
longer than that. In fact, I remember using Debian
*regularly, as my main Operating System* since the
[2.0 days](http://www.us.debian.org/releases/hamm/), which,
according to [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/), was released
on
[1998-07-24](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian#Debian_releases).
