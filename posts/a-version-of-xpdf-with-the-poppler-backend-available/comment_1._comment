There are some reasons:


	it is lighter (and depends on fewer packages, and is better for those using it remotely etc)
	it has the ability to zoom more, which both evince and epdfview don't; even if you patch them to use higher zoom levels, as they render the whole page at once, they will bring your computer to a halt
