Typed *a loooot* of things for the 5th chapter of my Master's
dissertation. The 5th chapter went from 10 pages to 17 pages in
Computer Modern 10pt. The whole dissertation goes from 90 pages to
more than 105 pages if I increase the font size from 10pt to 11pt
(and this is how it is going to be submitted).
