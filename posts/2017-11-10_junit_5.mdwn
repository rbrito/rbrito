If you want to use JUnit 5, the latest release of JUnit, from Eclipse, then
you have to change your import from `import org.junit.Test;` to `import
org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;`. Notice the `jupiter.api` there in the middle.

Otherwise, the test runner will complain and tell you that you don't have
tests in your project.

The not-so-minimal test that I created was the following:

    package test;
    
    import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.*;
    import static org.junit.Assert.*;
    
    import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
    
    class FirstTest {
    	@Test
    	void test() {
    		assertThat(1+1, is(equalTo(2)));
    	}
    }
