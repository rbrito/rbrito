[[!meta title="SNA Acceleration vs. UXA Acceleration"]]

Seeing as recent versions of Xorg have made it into Debian's testing (which
I am using right now, instead of my usual sid installations), I decided to
see what they would bring me in terms of performance, since they have the
SNA acceleration implemented as well as the standard UXA acceleration.

Well, I did not have any other tests to perform, but below are the results
on my wife's laptop (a Core i5 2410M), when running [[!debpkg gtkperf]]:

# With UXA

    GtkPerf 0.40 - Starting testing: Mon Aug 12 20:33:20 2013
    
    GtkEntry - time:  0.19
    GtkComboBox - time:  5.36
    GtkComboBoxEntry - time:  3.59
    GtkSpinButton - time:  0.60
    GtkProgressBar - time:  0.41
    GtkToggleButton - time:  0.73
    GtkCheckButton - time:  0.48
    GtkRadioButton - time:  0.97
    GtkTextView - Add text - time: 21.72
    GtkTextView - Scroll - time:  2.29
    GtkDrawingArea - Lines - time:  6.18
    GtkDrawingArea - Circles - time:  6.74
    GtkDrawingArea - Text - time:  4.32
    GtkDrawingArea - Pixbufs - time:  0.67
     --- 
    Total time: 54.25

# With SNA

    GtkPerf 0.40 - Starting testing: Mon Aug 12 20:36:58 2013
    
    GtkEntry - time:  0.21
    GtkComboBox - time:  4.86
    GtkComboBoxEntry - time:  2.67
    GtkSpinButton - time:  0.59
    GtkProgressBar - time:  0.24
    GtkToggleButton - time:  0.61
    GtkCheckButton - time:  0.51
    GtkRadioButton - time:  1.00
    GtkTextView - Add text - time: 17.19
    GtkTextView - Scroll - time:  1.84
    GtkDrawingArea - Lines - time:  2.70
    GtkDrawingArea - Circles - time:  2.65
    GtkDrawingArea - Text - time:  1.72
    GtkDrawingArea - Pixbufs - time:  0.11
     --- 
    Total time: 36.91

So, with SNA, the timing that I get are almost 2 times lower, which is
superb for a very simple `/etc/X11/xorg.conf` config file:

    Section "Device"
            Identifier "Intel Graphics"
            Driver "intel"
            Option "AccelMethod" "sna"
    EndSection

I have not noticed any change, but if drawing graphics faster means that I
get a bit more of battery life, then I will be super happy. I still have not
tested if this works on my notebook with a Core2Duo T7250. Crossing my
fingers so that it does.
