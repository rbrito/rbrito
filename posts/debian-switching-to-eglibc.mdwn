[[!meta  title="Debian Switching to EGLIBC"]]

Having been playing with some new things in <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, like the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/magicfilter"><code>magicfilter</code></a> package, which is a superb, lightweight solution to all my printing problems: to use a PCL 3 printer. I think that I will also "manufacture" a solution with a metapackage of a live CD that includes the environment that I use frequently, with the packages that I use (this is probably quite leaner than what <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> has done with their distribution, since I will mainly use some lighter packages).

Oh, talking about lighter packages, I see that Debian has adopted a new C library, namely <a href="http://www.eglibc.org/">EGLIBC</a>, which stands for Embedded LIBC. Finally, it seems that Debian will focus a bit more on smaller systems (which is a good thing, because computing resources are limited).
