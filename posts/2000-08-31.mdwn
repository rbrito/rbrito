Ugh! Discovered that the
[ADSL service I was planning to sign](http://www.speedy.com.br)
blocks incoming calls to SMTP and HTTP ports -- since I don't trust
anyone to receive and manage my e-mails, I had a plan of setting up
my own e-mail server. Fsck! If the providers can't get their
freaking job done The Right Way (tm), why do they prevent their
customers from doing it themselves?? It costs them absolutely
nothing. I mean *nothing*.

Also discovered that I'll have a class of "Probabilistic Method"
during my birthday and only this class. This means that I'll have
to endure hours of traffic just to get here to see the class and
then more painful hours to go back home.
