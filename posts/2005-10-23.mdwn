Today was voting day and that sucks.

My "dreams" of using DocBook/XML to generate my documentation
ceased to be when I read that passivetex is barely maintained. And,
actually, trying to use [xmlto](http://packages.debian.org/xmlto)
with a very simple document seems to generate good XHTML, but
doesn't even work when one tries to generate DVI or PS or PDF
output.

Perhaps I should try to use
[docbook-utils](http://packages.debian.org/docbook-utils) instead.
