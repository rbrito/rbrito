There's something that needs to be documented somewhere, since it
is not obvious when skimming the documentation and when one is
using
[`git-buildpackage`](http://packages.debian.org/git-buildpackage):

* **Q:** How does one specify a key to git-buildpackage that
  doesn't match the ones that it *thinks* that you should use?
  **A:** Just specify that you want it to use a "builder" different
  that the default one, like the option
  `--git-builder="debuild -i\.git -I.git -krbrito"`.
* **Q:** How does one tells that the source should always be
  included (say, like one of your collaborators already tagged a git
  repository with the debian revision and you need to make a change
  to upload it and commit another tag to the repository or, e.g.,
  when a security upload should be made to security.debian.org)?
  **A:** The answer is almost the same. Use the option
  `--git-builder="debuild -i\.git -I.git -sa"`.
