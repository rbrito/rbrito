Today, [KDE 2.0.1](http://www.kde.org) was released. To be honest,
I didn't notice any changes between KDE 2.0.1 and KDE 2.0, but at
least the packages are newer and potentially contain new packaging
fixes also. So, I'm keeping it updated.

As I said earlier, I'm keeping a local mirror of it with rsync and
I'm planning on putting a CD with these sweet extra things for
Debian potato (and my locally packaged programs, of course). Now,
if I only could get XFree86 4.0.1 for potato, I'd be very happy.
