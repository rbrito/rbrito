Finally, the text that I have been writing for some time now was
submitted for the Qualifying Examination of my Master's Degree!
This is a landmark in my career and many doors may be open for me
now, with many more professional possibilities. It also means that
I'll soon be having to present my work.

So I have already downloaded the whole
[OpenOffice suite](http://www.openoffice.org) for Linux, which
enables me to make presentations compatible with Microsoft's
Powerpoint without ever touching Microsoft software. OpenOffice has
already reached the beta status and I think that now is the time to
give it a try.

Went to the shopping mall and later to the supermarket with my
sweet girlfriend and bought CDs that I found in the bargain bin for
only R$ 2.80 a piece. Got Paul Dianno's solo CD in the bunch.
