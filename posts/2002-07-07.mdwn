Woke up quite early with that kernel panic bugging me. I read the
documentation and the fix for it was to reboot MacOS 9 (which
wasn't as simple as it should, since MacOS X apparently de-blessed
MacOS 9's System Folder). Anyway, after reusing XPostFacto, the
PowerMac booted with MacOS X! Woohoo!

Well, seeing this OS booting on this old computer is quite cool.
Well,
[apart from some severe usability problems](http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=33385&cid=3607384)
and slowness, MacOS X is an amazing operating system. The problem
is: it **is slow**. It is slow with a G3 600MHz (100MHz of bus)
with 128MB of RAM and, obviously, much more so with a dual 604e
180MHz with only 64MB of RAM.

BTW, MacOS X isn't able to use both processors when it is booted
with XPostFacto.

BTW\#2, XFree86's native driver for Mach64 doesn't include support
for the XVideo extension.

Also used the client-side of NFS and SMB on MacOS X, which is quite
easy to use.
