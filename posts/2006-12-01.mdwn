It seems that [Debian](http://www.debian.org/)'s
[Etch](http://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) won't be released on
the 4th of December, which is a pity (and understandable, as the
release managers want a quality release). I would, OTOH, like to be
using some bleeding edge stuff (newer than what is currently in
unstable).

The nice thing for me is that the following packages are in Debian
proper:

* [mt-daapd](http://packages.debian.org/mt-daapd);
* [videolink](http://packages.debian.org/videolink);
* [GCC 4](http://packages.debian.org/gcc);
* [easytag](http://packages.debian.org/easytag);
* [teTeX](http://packages.debian.org/tetex-bin);
* [TeX Live](http://packages.debian.org/texlive);
* [AUCTeX](http://packages.debian.org/auctex);
* [ekiga](http://packages.debian.org/ekiga).
