It's been quite a long time since I last wrote anything here. In
the mean time, [orkut](http://www.orkut.com/) has changed my life
(for the worse) and it seems that I'm now "up for adoption" again.
Maybe [Oz](http://www.cs.newcastle.edu.au/~nbi/) isn't that far
away. Or maybe it is. I still don't know. The last missing piece
(the
[Test of English as a Foreign Language](http://www.toefl.org/)) was
completed and the only problem now is the competition for
scholarships.

In the mean time, I
[packaged](http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2004/10/msg00325.html)
[PPower4](http://www-sp.iti.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/software/ppower4/),
which works perfectly now with all the
[Free](http://www.kaffe.org/) [JVMs](http://www.sablevm.org/) in
[Debian's testing](http://www.debian.org/releases/testing/), which
means that one can depend on even less non-free software.

In fact, the very reason that Free JVMs entered testing were the
reason for me to pick up [Java](http://java.sun.com/). It seems to
be a nice language and the fact that it doesn't present a problem
to [Free Software](http://www.fsf.org/) makes it a plausible
addition in my book.

I also patched iTunes 4.7 to work with iPod Download. The
hard-coded blacklist that Apple put in iTunes isn't nice.

[Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntulinux.org/), on the contrary **is**
nice. Also nice is the fact that
[algorithms](http://texcatalogue.sarovar.org/entries/algorithms.html)
is now Free (and soon will be back into
[teTeX](http://www.tug.org/tetex/), which is what ships with
[Debian](http://www.debian.org/)). I am happy, because this means
that my local home directory will get a tiny bit smaller, with less
cruft. And [The Global Operating System](http://www.debian.org/)
even more powerful.

And [faac](http://sf.net/projects/faac/)'s package made by
Christian Marillat now works with the MP4 wrapper, which means that
now I can use [grip](http://nostatic.org/grip/) with AAC files for
[iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod/) and use its space in a slighlyt
more efficient manner (well, at least I hope so).

Oh, BTW, I hate daylight savings time and it seems that now I'm
back in love with Elementary Number Theory. If only Elementary
Number Theory liked me...
