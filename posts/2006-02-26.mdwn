Playing with [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/), I
discovered that the [camera](http://www.samsungcamera.org/) saves
the pictures with "quality" settings of 95%, 85%, and 70% when
using "super fine", "fine", and "normal" settings for compression,
respectively. This answers one of the questions that I had in mind
when I started using this camera. Now, the other one is "which
resolution to use?".
