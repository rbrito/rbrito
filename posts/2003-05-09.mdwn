My dissertation is basically finished now. All chapters are either
already completely written or they have only details left (like
changing the language, checking the correctness of proofs etc). The
first two chapters are almost consumer-ready. The others are what
is worrying me.

And now things are just a bit different, as it seems that I have a
kind of deadline to worry about. A *hard* deadline, that is. It's
25th of June, which must not be missed.
