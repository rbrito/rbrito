Happy Easter for those who celebrate it! And it's all about
chocolate eggs. I love that (even though I have been limiting my
consumption of chocolate to a manageable minimum).

And I should say (once more) that I hate preparing tests. But one
thing that I hate more than preparing tests is scoring them,
especially when students make some confusing solutions that
*partially* solve the problem, but takes you almost an hour to
notice that! And that's just for one question...

Downloading huge quantities of new material, thanks to
[easytree.org's torrents](http://www.easytree.org/). Many
[Opeth](http://www.opeth.com/) and
[Porcupine Tree](http://www.porcupinetree.com/) bootlegs, including
videos. Oh, and some old-school Metallica. I'm also seeding many
torrents (right now, five).

Well, since [news.individual.net](http://news.individual.net/) is
going to be paid starting from April 1st, I was checking if my
damned [ISP](http://www.uol.com.br/) provides news. That's not
because I don't want to pay news.individual.net, but rather because
I felt that I shouldn't be using an external news server, since I
am already paying for Internet access and, IMNSHO, Usenet is one of
the basic services that every provider has to provide.

Well, I am sincerely considering going to sign up with
[their competitor](http://www.terra.com.br/), which has a huge
amount of groups in their service, including those that I want to
read (i.e., [comp.theory](news:comp.theory),
[comp.text.tex](news:comp.text.tex), [comp.emacs](news:comp.emacs),
and [sci.math](news:sci.math)).
