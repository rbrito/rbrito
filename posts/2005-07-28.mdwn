Just finished reading neat and combinatorial proofs of "Fermat's
Little Theorem" and "Wilson's Theorem" (although only in one
direction) in George E. Andrews's "Number Theory" book from
[Dover](http://www.doverpublications.com).

While this seems to be an elementary book on Number Theory (it
covers just the basics---which I have been trying to learn for some
time now) it is also *quite* well-written. Perhaps some writers of
computer books could learn a thing or two with Mathematicians.
