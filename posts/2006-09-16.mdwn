Some tools related to digital photography:

* A 2GB SD card, which at the maximum resolution that I'm using
  with the camera that I have here, gives me around 4500 photos;
* A small tripod, so that I can play with photos with a "fill
  flash" or completely without flash and without getting the images
  blurry;
* An adaptor to the SD card so that it can be used just like an
  USB pen/thumb/whatever-drive;
* Two pairs of rechargeable AAA batteries;
* A battery recharger;
* The smallest (in physical terms) USB pen/thumb/whatever-drive
  that I could get, with 1GB of size. Nice for getting things along
  with me.
