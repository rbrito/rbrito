The easiest way of using git locally to commit to a CVS repository is to
have *both* a git clone of the CVS repository *and* a CVS checkout of your
repository.

# Initial steps that Work for Me (TM)

1. Create your git clone of the CVS repository:

    git cvsimport -v -a -A /tmp/lame-authors.txt -k -m -d \
        :ext:rbrito@lame.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lame lame

 The command above will create your clone of the CVS repository in the
 current directory which we suppose, for the sake of this discussion, is
 `/tmp/gitified`.

 If want to specify a directory different than what you're in, then you
 should add the option `-C /path/to/git/repository`.

2. Create a checkout of the CVS repository for CVS work stuff (I'm checking
  out things under `/tmp`):

    cvs -z3 -d:ext:rbrito@lame.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lame checkout lame

  This will create your CVS checkout on the directory `/tmp/lame`, assuming
  that you are working under `/tmp`, as I do.

# Doing real work

3. Go to your git clone (`/tmp/gitified`) and start hacking, committing, etc.

4. When it is time to send your patches to the CVS repo, you have to:

    export GIT_DIR=/tmp/gitified/.git
    cd /tmp/lame
    git cherry origin master | sed -n 's/^+ //p' | xargs -l1 git cvsexportcommit -c -p -v
    
  This will automatically check in all the commits that you have made in
  step 3.
  
# Continuing your work afterwards

5. First, discard your commits in your git repository, so that you don't get
   further problems with `git cvsimport`.
6. Update your git repository with the current contents of the CVS repo:

    cd /tmp/gitified
    git cvsimport -v -a -A /tmp/lame-authors.txt -k -m -d \
        :ext:rbrito@lame.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lame lame

7. Update your CVS repository with the current contents of the CVS repo too:

    cd /tmp/lame
    cvs update

# Conclusion

Of course, I would prefer a simpler, leaner workflow. If you happen to have
one, please let me know.
