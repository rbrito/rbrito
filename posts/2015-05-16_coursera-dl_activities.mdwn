Lately, I have been dedicating a lot of my time (well, at least compared to
what I used to) to Free Software projects. In particular, I have spent a
moderate amount of time with two projects written in Python.

In this post, I want to talk about the first, more popular project is called
[coursera-dl][coursera-dl-gh].  To be honest, I think that I may have
devoted much more time to it than to any other project in particular.

[coursera-dl-gh]: https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera

With it I started to learn (besides the practices that I already used in
Debian), how to program in Python, how to use unit tests (I started with
Python's built-in [`unittest`][unittest] framework, then progressed to
[nose][nosetests], and I am now using [pytest][pytest]),
[hooking up the results of the tests][coursera-dl-travis] with a continuous
integration system (in this case, [Travis CI][travisci]).

[unittest]: https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html
[nosetests]: https://nose.readthedocs.org/
[pytest]: http://pytest.org/
[coursera-dl-travis]: https://travis-ci.org/coursera-dl/coursera
[travisci]: https://travis-ci.org/

I must say that I am sold on this idea of testing software (after being a
skeptical for way too long) and I can say that I find hacking on other
projects without proper testing a bit uncomfortable, since I don't know if I
am breaking unrelated parts of the project.

My use/migration to pytest was the result of a campaign from `pytest.org`
called [Adopt Pytest Month][apm] which a kind user of the project
[let me know about][pytest-bug-report].  I got a
[very skilled volunteer][meeja] assigned from pytest to our project.
Besides learning from their pull requests, one side-effect of this whole
story was that I spent a moderate amount of hours trying to understand how
properly package and distribute things on [PyPI][pypi].

One tip learned along the way: contrary to the official documentation, use
[twine][twine], *not* [`python setup.py upload`][upload-command]. It is more
flexible for uploading your package to PyPI.

[apm]: http://pytest.org/latest/adopt.html
[pytest-bug-report]: https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera/issues/317
[meeja]: https://meejah.ca/
[pypi]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi
[twine]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine
[upload-command]: https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/packageindex.html#the-upload-command

You can see [the package on PyPI][coursera-dl-pypi].  Anyway, I made the
first upload of the package to PyPI on the 1st of May and it already has
almost 1500 download, which is far more than what I expected.

A word of warning: there are other similarly named project, but they don't
seem to have as much following as we have. A speculation from my side is
that this may be, perhaps, due to me spending *a lot* of time interacting
with users in the bug tracker that github provides.

Anyway, installation of the program is now as simple as:

    pip install coursera

And all the dependencies will be neatly pulled in, without having to mess
with multi-step procedures. This is a big win for the users.

Also, I even had an [offer to package the program][package-in-debian] to
have it available in Debian!

[package-in-debian]: https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera/pull/288#issuecomment-69610097

Well, despite all the time that this project demanded, I think that I have
only good things to say, especially to the original author, [John Lehmann][john]. :)
