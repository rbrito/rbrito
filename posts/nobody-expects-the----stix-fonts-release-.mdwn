Please, excuse me if you are a connoisseur of fonts and typography. You will
find this boring, but other people may not know.

With that said, something that has been the subject of a joke for
[many years][0] is the release of a set of fonts designed by a consortium of
pulishers to create a typeface that would "match" the visual of Times, but
that would have many (all?) of the glyphs needed by scientists.

Well, [the wait is over][1] (surprisingly). I didn't expect that. And the
Free Software part of this is that the fonts were released under the SIL
Open Font Library.

This, together with Google's new [font directory][2] of Free Software fonts
(overshadowed by the release of VP8 codec, in the eyes of some), shows that
the typographic arena is alive and going strong.
