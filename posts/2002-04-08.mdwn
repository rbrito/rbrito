Basically did nothing. But my blood went to analysis and a partial
result is now available. I think that I'll have to start a diet,
cut a bit of the chocolate and start doing (physical) exercises.

Also played a tiny bit with Python. It's starting to grow on me.
I'm a newbie right now, but I already found some problems where the
[Standard Documentation](http://www.python.org/doc/current/tut/tut.html)
is not entirely clear. And I also found differences of behavior
between [CPython](http://www.python.org/) and
[Jython](http://www.jython.org/) regarding the `readlines()` method
of a file object when called with an argument. Is that a bug,
perhaps? If it is, then I'm surprised that nobody found it yet.

Subscribed to the [Tutor](http://www.python.org/) mailing list to
see if I am missing something. Cancelled some of my Yahoo!
accounts.

Sent an e-mail to [my bank](http://www.bb.com.br/) telling them
that they suck, because their site doesn't work with any of the
Linux browsers that I tried ([Opera](http://www.opera.com/),
[Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/), and
[Konqueror](http://www.konqueror.org/)).
