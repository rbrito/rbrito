It seems that my 160GB IDE HD is back to life. I will check it
again, but the "magic" was to just write data on it, causing it to
remap the defective blocks. Thank you for the engineers that know
that machines *will* fail.

And I tried to get oggenc-aotuv compiled for amd64. The package is
in a sad state, unfortunately, and even after I changed the sources
a little bit.
