Got a new [Internet](http://www.flash.net.br/) connection. It's
cable modem and the quality is variable. I'm still evaluating it,
though. Some problems like reverse-DNS not properly configured
comes to mind.

On the other hand, the DHCP connection is "authenticated" by the
MAC address of the card. When I showed that it was so easy to fake,
the cable guy didn't even believe what he saw. Is this bad news?

My car has almost turned junk due to vandalism of freshmen that
just got into the College. Poor souls. They don't know what to
expect when they take classes.
