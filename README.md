# Rog√©rio Brito's blog

This repository contains the source for compilation of my blog. It is written in a way that ikiwiki works with, but I'm not that satisfied with the speed of compilation, the readability of the (Perl) code nor with the lack of community of users supporting plugins for ikiwiki.

If you happen to know of another static compilation system that works well with markdown-formatted posts and that is able to run on a mere ARMv5 system with only 128MB of RAM, please let me know and I will probably switch right away.
